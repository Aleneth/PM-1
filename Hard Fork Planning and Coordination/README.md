# Hard Fork Planning and Coordination

This document is a work in progress and will be updated as we go.

## Description

In Ethereum [All Core Dev meeting #56](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2056.md), it was discussed that Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) should be assigned the task of future HardFork coordination. Ethereum Network Upgrade Process was proposed by Afri S. as [EEP-5](https://github.com/karalabe/eee/issues/5) in Dec 2018.

The goal is to define a standard process for Istanbul and future upgrades which all client developer teams may follow.

## Istanbul Hard Fork 

* [EIP-1679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679)  - Meta EIP 

### How to propose EIP for Istanbul?
Create a new issue at [ECH](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues) repository referring "EIP# to be considered for next upgrade (Meta EIP#)", before the [deadline](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/milestone/2)  May 17, 2019 for acceptance of proposals. Refer [EIP 1929](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/16e64a488cd16403b884417799074aae77be41ab/EIPsForHardfork.md) for process flow.
