# Hard Fork Planning and Coordination

This document is a work in progress and will be updated as we go.

## Description

In Ethereum [All Core Dev meeting #56](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2056.md), it was discussed that Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) should be assigned the task of future HardFork coordination. Ethereum Network Upgrade Process was proposed by Afri S. as [EEP-5](https://github.com/karalabe/eee/issues/5) in Dec 2018.

The goal is to define a standard process for Istanbul and future upgrades which all client developer teams may follow.
