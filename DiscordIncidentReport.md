Ethereum Cat Herders Discord is a community that we've built for the users interested about Ethereum, interested in contributing to the ecosystem. On  Friday, December 03, 2021, a random user shared a phishing link on multiple channels of the ECH Discord. I received the notification from Wick bot and also Micah Zoltu, an EIP editor, alarmed to remove the msg in order to protect users of the server. 
I was operating from my cell phone and tried to remove the user from the server and remove the link from different channels. In the attempt it was accidentally clicked on one of the channels. Though I closed the tab immediately and imagined that everything was under control. I did respond on the server thanking him for the alert and that I have removed the link. 

Only after a few hours did I receive notification on Telegram from one of the Etherscan team members that someone from his team has reported that the Ethereum Cat Herder Discord is not accessible. Before I could realize and respond to the situation, I had lost control over my Discord and the three servers that I manage for different communities of the Ethereum ecosystem.   At that point I realized the damage was more than I could have imagined. After some quick due diligence , I wrote an email to Discord support explaining the issue asking for resolution, started informing the ECH team and with some consensus we find it's important to inform the community to be safe and be on alert for possible scams / fake discords.

I received a ticket number from the Discord team but due to the weekend, I wouldn't have expected any immediate actions. So, I spent a few later hours doing some googling to see if there is anything that can be done about it. Looking into the invite link, gave me an impression that there is a possibility of getting the server back as it is still active. (Image below)

The Arrow Glacier upgrade was in less than 5 days, and being uncertain of if and when Discord support can help us recover the lost group, the next day I started the effort of reconnecting lost group members to a newly created ECH discord server. I would like to thank Etherscan, Micah Zoltu, Tim Beiko, Darkiscool, Alen, Mryalamanchi, Muddlebee and many ECH contributors who helped get the new Ethereum Cat Herders Discord server & users back.

The Discord team responded yesterday, "**Unfortunately, Discord staff does not interfere with individual server management and if the server was deleted, there is no way to restore it.**" 


## What are we doing to prevent this in future?
This incident gave us the opportunity to restructure the Discord channel. We have added bots to aid with additional security at the time of joining the server. Wick bot is more strict and will kick users out of the server failing compliance. I have also enabled 2FA on Discord that wasn't there earlier.
We look forward to your suggestions and contribution to make this server a safer community for our users. 

As Cat Herders, we want to provide maximum support to the Ethereum community especially at the time of any network upgrade. Glad to be back!
