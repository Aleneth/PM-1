The first report on outreach was published a few weeks ago. This second round of outreach is focused more on wallets and exchanges.

The second report hasn't been published yet, maybe in the subsequent month.

## All core dev

Only handled a few subjects. 
- A proposal for a basic tree structure, not yet drafted
- EIP-2926, chunk based merkalization. Discussed complexity. Will self organize conversations

YOLOv2
- Geth and Besu will be joining, Nethermind won't until EIP-2929 has stable tests. 

Conversation started on proper gas prices. Then discussion on sticking to timelines for testnets and network upgrades. Discussion around 2929, 2718, and 2930, how much time to be put into them, and how much of importance they were.

Recorded an episode with Nethermind CTO. Highly recommended people watch it.

The next EIP recording will be EIP-2718 with Micah Zoltu, typed transaction. It's a core EIP, which will help with future upgrades, such as EIP-1559.

It will be at 13:00 UTC, November 3rd.

Moloch 3 month funding is over now. Hudson is looking to submit the new proposal within a week. 

Looking for another initiative to increase community participation, which we can request funding for. 

Alita still recommends the hackathon, or looking into bounties. Alita recommends Jaye to lead this.

Pooja would like to increase what the Cat Herders are involved with.

This weeks newsletter will go today. Medium enabled new features. What is a way we can collect email? We don't even provide the subscribe feature on our website. 

Social media campaign is one way. People are still visiting the website. The website is on Github. We just need to make a pull request, and it's there.

Alita has volunteered to help redesign the website.

**Brent**: is there any way to track which client is supporting which EIP?

A few ways to see which client is working on which proposal is the All Core Devs call. 

If someone is championing, they get in touch with client representatives. 

In one of the breakout meetings, there was an alternative proposal for how to track this, EIP-2935.
