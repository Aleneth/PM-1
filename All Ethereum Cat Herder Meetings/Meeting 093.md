## Intro [0.00](https://youtu.be/Oy0rMM38MWY)
**Pooja**
* Welcome to Ethereum Cat Herders meeting 93. I have shared agenda in chat and let's start with the very first item that is Ethereum Network upgrade. So as we all know, merge is almost here. We are expecting,  TTD in about one day and 14 hours. It is exciting to see like the mainstream awareness is being supported by seeing from Google and others. Google have created a Toodle countdown for the merge upgrade. Last week, Belletrix went well, like Belletrix upgrade was good. Mainnet shadow fork 30 also was good. One issue with Argon was,  reported, but it was a mistake. So basically there was no client issue reported. MSF 13 was the last shadow folk as many of us know, that developers decided to continue doing shadow fork till we reach Merge and we are almost here. So we have this collection of all the shadow fork and other testnet and dev nets that,  where,  for the merge updated on Ethereum Cat Herders website in the merge page 
* One other announcement related to main net merge is Ethereum Cat Herders in association with the Eth Stakers, bankless, the Daily Way, Ethereum client developers and other community members have planned a live stream from the Ethereum Foundation YouTube. Check out the link in agenda for the merge viewing party. 
* An important announcement related to,  developers and people who were,  using,  Testnet that were launched during the merge upgrade. Kim is likely to be shut down. It started,  early this year and it'll be set shut down during,  the week of September 12. That is this week. Robston and Kiln be are also planned to be deprecated. Robston will be in Q4 2022 and Kiln be in Q3 2023. I took this information from Ethereum blog was, but I'm wondering why Kiln be there? 
* why is it being kept for so long? Like 2023. It should be, Shouldn't it be,  Sepolia? 

**William**
* So people should be migrating to Sepolia, but the meantime being that it has high traction with application devs mis they don't wanna sunset it so fast. 

**Pooja**
* Yeah, right. 

**William**
* I might, I mean, as a general PSA attending developers listening, Yeah. Like start using Sepolia. 

**Pooja**
* Yeah. Generally people are,  encouraged to move to Goerli or Sepolia, which will be, maintained and upgraded. for the, of course the Foresee feature for a long time, well check out the link,  on the Kiln shut down block post shared by Ethereum foundation. Thank you for updates here. Williams. I was getting confused like waiting for so long.
* Anyway, we are trying to have all these information added on Ethereum Cat Herders merge page, check out the website. Any question, comments so far? 

## Events & hackathon [3.47](https://youtu.be/Oy0rMM38MWY?t=227)
* Moving on,  I have listed a few events in hackathons so that those are going on. There will be a lot of around in,  many cities of South America. People may check out,  a few that I have listed here. One of, one of the topmost is Ethereum Protocol Fellowship. They're having the third cohort of, kind of,  internship program for inviting client development developers. The applications are accepted through September 16, and the program will start from October, 2022. Check out the link for more information. If you are an aspiring developer, would like to contribute to Ethereum blockchain, you may want to get a proper internship over here.
* A few other are e online that started from the 1st of September. It is planned to be there till September 30th. Next is MCON which will be starting from 15 to 17, and there is this main net in New York. It's a big event,  for Ethereum community as well as the blockchain community in general. I'm hoping to be talking in mainnet on Ethereum governance and the process improvement that Ethereum Cat Herders are supporting. Of course, devcon is there in the month October, date mentioned here is 11 to 14. 
* There is ETH India, which is in association with the Eth global. That will start from December 2nd to 4th. So that's about events.

## ECH updates [5.45](https://youtu.be/Oy0rMM38MWY?t=345)
**Pooja**
* Moving on, ECH updates. Last week I shared the stats for this discord where we were about a thousand users. Now we have a hundred more added to the thousand, so that is good. On YouTube, we are having over 2,700 subscriber, but this is like relatively low in compassion to that content. Those are being viewed on our channel. Looks like many users view, but they do not subscribe. However, we highly encourage people to subscribe to Ethereum Cat Herders YouTube channel because not only we have all these meetings, but we also have dates from research team as well going on. So please, please, please subscribe the channel.
* ECH  website, as I mentioned earlier, we have been working,  with someone to,  update the page regularly. I'm expecting a PR by today to have more updates on the merge page and we will try to have a separate page for Shanghai so we can keep track of Shanghai and people may find all the information related to the proposals and what's going on in the discussion on Ethereum Cat Herders website.

**Pooja**
* That's a very good feedback. Yep. I think initially we considered that there should be a guest log in that may allow user to,  just connect it without, I mean like maybe able to use the app without connecting to the wallet.  that's a good point that we would like to bring it in meeting today. Thank you for sharing. No problem.

* Last one for today is a review of outstanding action items. I am just trying to open the meeting notes here. Okay. so it looks like we do not have any immediate action items. I was supposed to share stats of social account. I'm hoping to share,  every meeting and maybe it'll help more users who are visiting but not subscribing or not following us may start following us. And, yeah, so we, we are working GitPOAP. There is a following error. We will fix it. we are working with GitPOAP team and yes,  there is a mention of timely submission of notes. That's very important. Even for this fortnight, we see that one notes is missing. I may have to check with the user, but I'm requesting all contributors. If you are accepting the notes. If you are giving confirmation, please try to submit your notes within five days. Three days is generally recommended, but at the most within five days, please do submit your notes to make it available for community to follow along.

I really enjoyed the last one and I, and I will be there as a listener because for the learning process of, for the ecosystem. They are really, again, thank you. 

**Pooja**
* Well that's so sweet. Thank you,  Jose for the comment.  yes, we thought that we have spent a decent amount of time in preparing editors and reviewers Now,  we can extend our support to authors so they be able to document what they're experiencing and they think that it should be added as an Ethereum standard. So,  this is especially for them and I'm aware that, a couple of people are also working and preparing,  documents to maybe help these new authors. Annth from Fellowship of Ethereum magician mentioned,   about a Dos and don'ts list. I do have a draft copy of it, but I'm hoping to have a final version released very soon. So yeah,  people you may check out Ethereum Cat Herders discord and especially the EIP editors channel for any discussion related to EIP editing, EIP author or EIP process in general. And yeah, that's all. Anyone else has anything for today or maybe for future meeting that they would like us to include?
