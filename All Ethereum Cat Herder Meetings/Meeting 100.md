# 1. Ethereum network upgrades

Video | [0:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=a9oZutWIzSY&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
-|-

## Shanghai page at ECH website

Shanghai tentative date is March 2023. The specs aren't frozen yet. Still discussing EIPs to be included. Focus is around withdrawals. Details to be discussed in ACD meeting.

## EOF Devnets Breakout Room Recording 5 Notes

Recording, notes available: 
- Recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-sUTwCvm6M
- Notes: https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/EOFBreakOutNotes#-Notes-5

Main specs outcome is to not allow data copy opcode. The reason is they want EIPs to be included in Shanghai, and major changes may delay the upgrade. 

After ACD, should decide if EOF is included in Shanghai.


## Withdrawal Testnet

Peep an EIP around this. Recommended to watch this episode, for approaches for testing. Currently in the 3rd or 4th phase of testing.

Devnets to be proposed this week.

## ECH website

We updated the website with the Shanghai upgrade details.

We're trying to integrate Calendar, so people can find which meeting happens when.

Currently, we're announcing events in the discord.

## ECH engineering

https://l2e.ethereumcatherders.com/

Learn2Earn, was constrained with the number of Poaps, because they gave us only a limited number. We were unable to get enough Poaps in time.

We started making our own NFTs. Currently live in Mumbai testnet.

There's no changes to the site, but now you have your own NFT made for each course. 

Planning launch on the Polygon testnet, next week.

We are adding more quizes once the Polygon NFT deployment goes out.

Keeping it on the testnet for a week, then moving it to the mainnet.

We are keeping the Poap up for now. We're out of POAPs for one course. All the other ones are available still.

William was asked to be another signer on the multi-sig. He agreed.
