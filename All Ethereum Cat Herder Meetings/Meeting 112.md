# Intro
**Pooja Ranjan**
* Welcome to Ethereum Cat Herders meeting #112. Today we are joined by a project team called eips.fun. So before we get into the agenda, we would first go ahead with the project demo, and then we will have our usual. Let me welcome, Bruce and his team. so Bruce, if you can maybe introduce yourself and we'll start it from there. 

## 1. Project Demo - eips.fun with Mikely [0.25](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=26)

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah. Thank you, Pooja. Hey guys, I'm Bruce.  and I'm the project manager of And, I'm very happy to present our pro project to, stay. And, yeah, let me introduce my, team member. We are working on the e ERC grants, design, which is the important feature. I will mention it later. And Mike is a product manager of this product. So he's, designing the features and, functionalities from this project. Yeah, so, maybe let me share my screen. Is that okay? 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* That's all right. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah. okay. second, I need to enable the access. Cool. can you see my screen now? Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah. Nice. So, yeah, so yeah, it's fine. And, yeah, so be because we think, ERPs are like, more than standards. So, that's because, it is connected the whole entire ecosystem, right? So, therefore like, including Entire Foundation developers, writers. So that's the reason, why we built EIP found, because the connection we think are weak.
* Because if you look at the, details and the standard, we'll find, it's hard to, sometimes it's hard to understand because they have a lot of coding examples, jargons technical terms. So, we hope EIP found becomes the layer to, of the ERP ecosystem to make the connection wider and easier. So therefore, we, created a four parts of the EIP Bond product, like website, community newsletter, and grants.
* So, speaking about the websites, you can think it is a extended version of the official website. So we provided a better ui, ux, and, the ones, the search feature, like if you search, you can search some keywords or the EIP numbers, then you can open the details page, for that, ERP. And also, we provided like, type of contents or something like that, so you can have a better reading experience, sort of things and also some other features and spec. and, for the speaking, for the specific details of the EIP we aggregate high quality contents, so that make people feel, yeah, make it easier to find, more information.
* Like, for example, for ERC 4337, we will have the chat generated, a summary and the video, of course,  we will put, your interviews, on, in this position, for the ERC you have interviewed with authors and also adopted product.
* Yeah, something like that. And yeah, and for the reading and more and more later. yeah, so, this pretty much it for the website parts. 
* So you'll be wondering why not extend the official website. that's because official website cannot include, in information like, the products, articles, videos, etc, even though they are helpful and valuable for the readers, that's because, people may think, the Ethereum Foundation, endorse those projects, which is incorrect. So we think, those information should be maintained by the community and everyone, we build a process that everyone can contribute to this, content through GitHub, so everyone can make requests on it. yeah, we also think, this can help to connecting with communities like, ether, magicians,  that we'll grab the, the discussion from the Ether Magician forum and display and show it on the page. 
* Also, we will put, like, videos, related to the specific ERP on the page from Ethereum Cat Herders, and also the events on the, schedule on the newsletter. So we'll have people to figure out where to go to get the latest information from, EIPs. And also we provided newsletter, so it gonna help you to, stay updated with the community. we have created, like three issues. yeah, so like this one. So basically we'll, have the EIP updates, which is, summary or, meeting notes from the EIP editing meetings, and yeah, EIPIP meetings, etc
* So some keynotes and, also the e I p or the week, like, for example, for the the, Eth Global Hackathon, they're promoting ERC-6551. So we put more, insights and, some hackathon product or something like that on the newsletter to help you to figure out, like, the, the latest, the hottest topic for EIP and also, which give you some, story or interesting stories or history. for Ether, like, for the past week, there is a discussion, that there is discussion between and the vital regarding the account type abstraction in the beginning Ether. So yeah, we will also include this. Yeah, of course, we will also put some, events, EIP events, including the, Cat Herders calendar 
* or something like that to let our, subscriber know Yeah, very will to get the latest information. Yeah, of course. it's, absolutely free, so feel free to subscribe on the website. And the last part is, and the most important, exciting part is the EIP grants, which is, EIP based Grants school. and  we found there are some requirements from the, EIP based successful projects and authors, foundations, organizations, they would like to, support or be expected. The, EIP ecosystem are gonna grow up, right? 
* So for you example, for ERP 721, the EIP, they are successful projects like Opensay, blur, or some NFT marketplaces. They would like to say there are many, developers for, develop some tools on their EIP also, like, more and more EIP, extend their ability, based on the ERC 721, so they can put their grands or donation into this, EIP ground, based grounds pool, which might, which will be built, on the, SMART contract, which will be a smart contract. 
* And we will help to distribute to those, EIP supporters, like New Startup who based on the EIP, tech writers and EIP authors, editors who, supported this EIP. So this's gonna be a bridge between, EIP, granters Builder, startup, etc And also it's gonna grow EIP ecosystem with funding and grants. 
* So you, you can consider it as another version or, of, Bitcoin grants to provide a better, like funding, another funding way for Eth EIP ecosystem. Yeah. So our vision is to serve as layer to our EIP ecosystem, simplifying and accelerating the adoption of EIP. Yeah. So, this project is currently initiated, by LXDAO and Plancker. So LXDAO focused in web three. So we focus on, supporting web3 public groups and open source. So basically, the majority of our members are developer, who want to contribute by using, by coding.
* Yeah. And, Plancker is a group of people who dedicated to building the Ether ecosystem in Asia. Yeah, of course, we have some other advisors, including Victor, Joe, and other authors, And this is a completely, open source and community driven project. So everything is open, including the meeting, the weekly meeting, open source codes, and the process, etc.
* And speaking about the progress and the roadmap, for the past Q2, we have done the, website  tooling parts process, and, we have created, started creating the, newsletter and, some contents also, we are building connection with, communities like today, right?
* So we are building, connection with Ethereum Cat Herders, and for Q3, we're gonna design the EIP grants strategy with, experts.
* And this is, the midco, from Z. And also we are, gonna promote this project to help, many people know this project and use it, subscribe the newsletter to, yeah, keep updated, for the eip. So therefore, we need the operator, like who can manage the social media and the, relationship connection with different communities. yeah, some, something, some work like that. So if you guys, or if you know someone, good at that, yeah, please, reach me out so we can discuss further. And, yeah, so for the in the future, so we're gonna keep like promoting and, making good, high quality newsletters, et cetera. yeah, so we also, the public goes, we accept donation, the grants. Yeah. Okay.
* So that's pretty much it for, my simple presentation for the project. And, yeah, so feel free to go to to check it out. And, also you can join the Telegram group if you want to. Yeah, that's, pretty much it. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Thank you so much for this presentation, Bruce. this is definitely a good progress, towards tooling with respect to EIPs. I hope that the information shared will enable more new author to learn more about the process, and also to be able to, learn about how we are managing EIPs, sharing information with this. Also help developers to, you know, use those EIP and project. So thank you so much for your effort over here. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah, Thank you Pooja. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Anyone on the call? If you guys have any question, for this project or any suggestion to make it even better, please feel free to share and, do, where people can reach you if we could let, community know about it. 

**William**
* Great project. Happy to see. I mean, I think there'll probably be a certain level of discovery trying to figure out how to make things more accessible. The GT four plugin over there I think is actually very clever. it'd be interesting to see how, how it develops.
* And I think the motivation behind why you're doing it makes a ton of sense, and I think that it really has the potential to be a great project. So, yeah. Thanks for sharing. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah, Thank you. Thank you, Ian. Ah, yeah, feel free to this letter. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Yeah, Very well. so if I remember correctly, there was this conversation that perhaps you may need more people to ha help out with them. What would be the best place for interested people to maybe reach out to you guys? Is that okay to reach you somewhere on the discord?

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah, so we have like a, a telegram group, so Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, if you have interest, you can draw us in the, in the, in the group. Thank you. 

**Zik**
* So maybe You can share the Terry, the QR code of Telegram group. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Yeah, can you help me to generate one? 

**Zik**
* Let me find it. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Oh, okay. Yeah, I can send the need. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* If we can have the link of the presentation that you have just shared, and if you can have the QR code over there, we will be happy to share that presentation with community. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Ah, Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool. I'll add code, send the link to you. Thank you. 

# 2. Ethereum network upgrades [14.40](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=879)

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Very well, thank you so much, for the presentation. moving forward, to this Ethereum Cat Herders meeting, we'll go ahead and take a look at the Ethereum network upgrades updates, and, that will be followed by events fellowship hack related information and general discussion. Our guests are welcome to continue watching this meeting, and, we are really excited to have this project get more popularity in the ecosystem system.
* The first, item on the agenda was project demo, and now we are looking into the network upgrades. so from the latest client developers meeting, devnet-6, which is there for Deneb upgrade is passing test. DevNet six was focused on EIP 4844, so will be DevNet seven. It is expected to be launched this week. And, we would like to further test EIP 4844. So no other EIPs will be a part of DevNet seven as of now.
* However, we are hoping if everything goes good, DevNet eight will be fully featured DevNet with all proposals in. So by any chance, if this does not happen, that DevNet eight is not fully featured, perhaps the developers will revisit the upgrade timeline and we'll get to know more about the Deneb, Testnet and Minnet upgrade teams with Deneb, but we are expecting the deprecation of engine exchange transition configuration. Michal shared a Hack md, with the detailed process, that has to be done by the execution and consensus layer client development team. I will share the link to the HackMD in the agenda.
* I think I have not done it already. here is the link for people to refer in the chat, but I will also make sure to add it in the agenda we're developing.we are expecting another testnet, which is called Leski. the launch date will be March date, that would be September 15th. EF DevOps and, other, Testnet support team are working on development of this, Testnet. Genesis, for this is expected, Genesis State for this is expected to be ready by the end of July. And, Furry and team has got confirmation from client team to have it with, 1.7 million validators on board. 
* It's going to be a larger test net, which will eventually replace the Goerli test net, which, is a public test net for any project testing. we are expecting Holesky to be there, after September, of course. And, that would be testing Deneb. The progress of, the Genesis preparation can be tracked on, issue. I'm sharing the link here, that if Ethereum pm issue number 814, they can follow the comment and, they can track it. there is also a GitHub repository for, Holesky testnet particularly have shared link in the chat so people can follow that.
* Apart from that, there is one another EIP, which is kind of, going to be a big one for the upgrade following, tenon. And the EIP is 7002. It is execution layer triggerable exits. It's not going to be a part of Deneb or can upgrade, at the moment. but this has been merged as a draft and we hope to have this change coming up in the track or, whatever is considered to be the next network upgrade. So check out, EIP 7002. Other than that, I have added related links to EIP 4844 implementers call, and there is the list of, for Cancun EIP added here. 
* There's also a readiness checklist for Cancun. We are expecting a readiness checklist for, consensus layer. Soon people can follow the conversation, with the proposals of EIP for Deneb in PPE playlist link added to the agenda on other protocol development researcher, we have added links to virtual implementers call 2 and EUF meeting 17. People can also follow EUF mega specs. And if there is anyone interested in helping out with testing or writing test script for EUF mega aspects, please reach out to EUF developers or you can also reach out to me on Cat Herders discord.
* Scott, I'll be happy to point you towards the right person, of, contact you. 

# 3. Events, Fellowship, Hackathon [20.41](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=1241)
* Any question, comments so far? Very well. These were just the information from protocol upgrade sign. Moving on to the next section, which is event fellowship and the hackathon Devconnect - Istanbul , which we are expecting in November. This, this year, it's going to be, happening in Istanbul. They have announced a scholar program. The last date to apply to this scholar program is July 23rd. It's, it's a program where we are trying to invite, more people or individual experience or having knowledge in protocol development, web3 development, privacy, security, and more.
* Please check out the details of application and either you can apply or you can nominate someone here. The link is added in the agenda, and the email address is devconnect.scholars@ethereum.org 

# 4. General updates/discussion [21.43](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=1303)
* On general updates. So we have ECH stats, that for Twitter, discord, YouTube, and LinkedIn. We have also added the link for joining or following 
* Ethereum Cat Herders on various social media platform. I suppose we made some progress on ECH engineering side and updating the ECH website and page for Dencun. yeah, I see George on the call. George, do you have any update, to share, by the way? Great, it's a very good, opportunity to share more about the project and Istanbul. 

**George** 
* Hey, sorry, I was struggling to get off mute. yeah, I'm not, so when it comes to updates with, the Dencun, we, fixed a couple issues, in the page, where there was a mix up with  and confusing the execution layer and the consensus layer. and we also updated the, EIPs in consideration as well as the readiness checklist and, implementation table. so it should be pretty up-to-date, when you check out the, the page on the website. other than that, I don't think there's any other updates, unless we want to talk about the EIPs repository. but, that's kind of in, static mode, based on recent updates, so, Yeah. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Right. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. I think I totally missed on this part. There are few other EIP under consideration that could be a part of, Deneb upgrade. so the, my earlier list contains only five EIPs, which are part of Cancun, but there are, I suppose two more, 7044 perpetually valid signed voluntary exit and 7045 increase max attestation inclusion slot. people can follow that on Ethereum Cat Herders/dencun  page. these are also part of the next upgrade. And, thank you for adding the updates.
* And I can see the pages is like very well updated up until DevNet five. Perhaps we'll add DevNet six and seven there as well. And yes, I think it would be a good idea to share about, the, the e i p page that we are trying to improve here and provide a, a placeholder for people to share more about, their project. So it's not like, a detailed one like EIP S fund talked about, but on a very precise way. We, would, be hoping to have it displayed if you would like to maybe share more about that.
* Yeah, If you want me to share more about it, yeah, I mean, like, I suppose we were hoping to have the, Google sheet or yeah, like information shared in the form of Google Sheet and we'll update one of the pages of Ethereum Cat Herders.com, right? 

**George** 
* Yeah. So we wanted to make it pretty easy where, anyone could add, information related to, the existing EIP where they can provide, implementa like references to packages, implementations, as well as, like any projects that, well, projects that have implemented it, just as kind of like a nice resource for hackers and builders, to, implementing their own projects and, you know, just, yeah, provide more resources for that. it's to be used for anyone. So that could be like even other, projects if they want to have this as kind of like a reference for, their own projects for, you know, like say the, the ERC website and so forth. they can, this is just to add, as you know, additional help, Right? 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* The idea here is to just, have, this information shared to people like which project are using which EIP or ERC. So project using any particular ERC can add them as like, you know, project implemented this ERC, and they can also share their link, of the Github repository if they're open source, very well useful for other people, or as they can let people know more about their project and how, that ERCC helped building up the project. So that's gonna be a very high level information, and we are hoping to have, this page, Ethereum Cat Herders/eip page updated there, and we'll make, the Google sheet available over there. Did I miss out on anything or that's all we have to cover on this? 

**George**
* I think that's, Well, thank you. 

# ECH Operations [27.50](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=1669)

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Thank you so much. All right. the next one is ECH operations. we did create this community playlist in which we are trying to upload the PEEPEIP- shorts. And as I was talking to Bruce earlier, this meeting today that we would be hoping to have project demo separately added. and we'll try to share that with the community so people learn more about projects. I suppose. I was supposed to, start, project board for, the project demo project so people can, you know, select a date and reach out to us for demonstration of the project. I will make sure that it is created before the next meeting.
* So anyone listening to this call, if you're interested to share more about your project, in the Eth ecosystem, you can reach out to us on EthereumCatHerders discord and we'll be happy to have this project demo session allocated for you to share more and invite community participation over there. there was a couple of other bullet points. I am not sure if you made any progress. I'm wondering, Santhosh, if you would like to add anything? 

**Santhosh**
* Yeah, there's not much of the progress, but, with this call,  we'll try to split our meeting recording into two and one will be the project update upload alone. We can have a separate playlist that can be added by tomorrow. That is something I can work on. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* That would be great. Thank you. I will share the recording with you so you can work on it. And, yeah, the project board, thank you, for help here. I think I initiated, but somehow it was not completed, so we can check it from where it was left. I appreciate the offer. 

# ECH Podcast [29.44](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=1784)
* All right, on ECH podcast, I think we are up to date. We'll be releasing  PEEPanEIP podcast, for episode 111 this Thursday. And yeah, we are up to date on that. So we are continuously sharing every talk on Ethereum Cat herders podcast.
* * People can follow the podcast on EthereumCatHerders.com/podcast. And I'm just trying to verify the address. Yes, that's right. here we have information of all our, podcast platform like Apple castbox Review, PO Pocket, whatever is your favorite, podcast platform. You can find, EthereumCatHerders over there and you can follow, the conversation on PPE and many other interviews of projects earlier done by William Shaw. 
* It's kind of, jam. I would highly recommend following interviews and yeah, repeat any episodes over there. 

# PEEPanEIP [30.59](https://youtu.be/Be7mojkj6RE?t=1859)
* Next is PEEPanEIP Insight, and EIPs insight website. So for the month of July, we have one final EIP one in last call, and there is only one proposal in draft so far. It's just 4th of July today and, it's just four days back, so it's good for some time. There was some issue with the Eth pod and it was not merging. So the proposal 6381 public non fungible token EMO repository. It was approved in the past month, but it got merged this month. So that's the final ERC one proposal is in last call, which is ERC 6066 signature validation method for nft. The last call deadline is July 10th.
* We highly recommend people to share their feed feedback on Fellowship of Ethe Magician, if you have any, because once the proposal moves into the final status, 
* We may not be able to make any further changes to the proposal. There is this, one proposal which has been taken out from stat status number is ERC 3643 TEX token for regulated exchange. People can share their feedback, comments and thought on Fellowship of Ethereum magician. We look forward to have more updates in upcoming month.
* And yeah, people can also follow EIPS Insight website. I'm aware that team is working on having, a new look and feel for the present website. And perhaps we'll come up with some more, charts, and stats to provide better analytics of EIPS. It's good to see so many tools being developed around EIPs. There is another piece of information to be shared with the community following, EIPs and ERC in the last EIPIP meeting. there was the discussion and, in fact this discussion is there for quite some time about the split of the repo. ERC would be having a separate GitHub repository. This is going to be a change in process of submission proposal of ERC category only.
* And as of now, we do not see the change with respect to any other type or category. We are working on tooling. We are hope to have bot enabled for both repository, the EIPS repository and the ERC repository. We hope to have more information coming up from the past all ERC dev meeting. it, was shared, by, Victor that people do not have a ton of objection, like some, somewhere in support of the split. 
* Some said that we don't care and one person said that I have some concern. We will hope to answer all the related questions about this EIP repository split kind of thing. Please feel free to join EIPIP next meeting. If you have any thoughts to be shared with, the EIP editor in parallel. As I mentioned earlier, we are working on, having bots enabled. So both EIP depository and ERC depository may be able to function without any issues. On PEEPanEIP, this week we shared an EIP on keeping up with Gajendar sig.
* It was, about the specs, working and development on client side. We did share about e P 48 44 and the rollercoaster all client team went through in the development of implementation of this proposal on their client. there are a few more update, which I think validated community may value. So we recommend people to follow the recording. for episode 111, for upcoming PEEPanEIP meeting, please follow the scheduled length here on the agenda on meeting notes. I suppose we have received meeting notes for all meeting except ACDE 164. I'll have to check.

**Santhosh**
* Yeah, I ready. I just, shared the p and that if Okay, perfect. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Perfect. Thank you so much. 

**Santhosh**
* So There, so there was some issue with my GitHub. So there was two notes I have to share. One was the ECH111, and this both should be up in an hour. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Awesome. Very well, thank you so much. Oh, sorry. Did you mention about the consensus meeting, right? 

**Santhosh**
* Yeah. consensus One. One. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Okay. Yeah. Right. No, no. I think we do not have the ACDE meeting notes as well, so we'll have to check with the resource. 

**Santhosh**
* Okay. I'll check. Maybe I'll follow. Yeah. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Yeah. Cool. Thank you. I haven't got a chance to look into the update on Twitter side of ECH. contributors to some weekly tweets. I suppose they'll be working on this tweet or repost thing. Is that the correct understanding On the tweets? 

**Santhosh**
* On the tweets? Right

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Yeah, right. 

**Santhosh**
* Yeah, mostly we'll try to reshare it from the ECHsite. Maybe if I can get an access, I can start with it.

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Very well. I think, that is all. I would also like to share one other information. next, meeting will be joined by Project Octant. Project Octant, is a project by, Golem team and, they have considered Ethereum CAT herders for public good fundings. There are 10 projects considered for the first round of public good fundings. Ethereum cat herders are one of those. they would love to have some kind of, you know, voting done. And for that, we would need to coordinate it with POAP so people having these special POAP will be able to vote. They will be a snapshot, I think by 22nd of July, so people will be able to vote in, I think the last week of July. So Ethereum CAT herders  numbers, please, let me know if you are open to supporting that. And, I will share, the POAP, with you, anyone willing to support a Ethereum cat herders  for, you know, voting over there. 
* Please reach out to me. Yeah, thank you Bruce for sharing this information. and adding this in the comments so people can also follow. We have many developers. Okay, what one public goods and open source project. Thank you for the offer. Yeah, we would love to have. Cool. and I think that is all. Any, anything else anyone would like to comment, share, add? Very well. thank you so much everyone for joining us today and for people in the United States. Happy 4th of July. See you all in two weeks. Have a great day. 

**Bruce Xu**
* Thank you everyone. Cheers. Thank you, July. Bye everyone. You, bye-bye.
