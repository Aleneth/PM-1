## MEETING ACTIONS
- Action 13.1: Brett to discuss with Hudson how Cat Herders can help with EIP process 
- Action 13.2: Brett leave vote in ECH Gitter to set up a working group for helping ETH 2.0
- Action 13.3: Tim to compose Cat Herder talk proposal and post in ECH Gitter to discuss

## 1. Update on ProgPow Audit

**Brett:** ProgPOW will likely be delayed due to lack of contract and hardware auditor dropping out. 

**Tim:** Agreed that ProgPOW included in Istanbul is extremely unlikely

## 2. Hard Fork Coordination Update

**Brett:** Core Devs covering EIPs. Most EIP champions were absent from last Core Dev call so it was difficult to determine validity. Views expressed, notes taken, but no decision were made. Lots of subsequent discussion on Gitter channel. Apart from dates in place, no EIPs have been officially approved and moved forward. 

**Tim:** Is there some way Cat Herders can help this process out? It's a mess. A lot of core devs and EIP editors are spending valuable time trying to figure out this mess. Perhaps the Cat Herders can be helpful - but will another middle man be helpful? Seems pretty chaotic mostly because there's never been this many EIPs before. It's overwhelming the little infrastructure we have. 

**Hugo:** What do you think are the main issues? 

**Tim:** It wasn't clear until the EIP submission deadline what the expectation was for EIP comprehsiveness and completion. There was a dramatic increase in submissions right at the end with a whole range of largely complete EIPS to placeholders. The second issue is the overhead it takes to technically discuss these. There's been an effort on Gitter to have AMAs to parse through them. Another issue for the client implementers is the implementation deadline - a month away. Speaking for Pantheon, we have 0 implemented because 0 are accepted. If several are marked accepted right before the deadline, it's gonna slip. 

**Brett:** They tried to get through all of them in the last meeting and with so many on the table we really need to engage with the champions. Break it down to 10 and work through those and then the next 10 in the next call. And if the champion isn't present to defend their EIP, a hard call needs to be made to drop that EIP for Istanbul. 

**Tim:** One thing to note, the previous biggest hardfork had ~5 EIPs. This one could have more - what does that mean? We could get a hardfork with several more features. This should be discussed more. 

**Hugo:** For the first time we have to manage a funnel. If some are very incomplete, we need a process of determining the true stage of each one. 

**Tim:** Some of the last submissions, like state rent, have had a lot of technical work done it just hasn't been formatted as an EIP. Discussions on ETH Magicians where Danno suggested different EIP stages: "idea" - "spec" - "implemented". 

**Hugo:** We need to create this funnel of stages so people know where EIPs are at and what's expected. During Core Dev call are EIPs discussed on rolling basis or all at once at deadline?

**Tim:** Typically an EIP champion signals they'd like discussion and then it's discussed - so on a fairly rolling basis. This time we got to the deadline and there were ~30 EIPs that were not accepted or rejected so we discussed them all. 

**Brett:** Unfortunately discussion ensued without most of the EIP champions present. 

**Hugo:** I see 2 different issues. 1 issue is how we classify EIPs so we're only discussing those sufficiently developed. The 2nd would be enforcing some rule where is the champion isn't present, the EIP isn't discussed. 

**Tim:** I would only caveat this with we want this decision made on an by the Core Dev call. 

***Unanimous agreement***

**Brett:** I can bring this to Hudson and he can bring it up in the Core Dev call

**Hugo:** We have too many EIPs all at once. We want to find a process for handling these. One issue is determining how well developed the spec is and another is how we're supposed to have a technical discussion if the champion isn't present. We also have the issue of the technical overhead required to discuss so many issues and the issue of timing - several more EIPs within a very short period of time. Maybe we should discuss a limit on the number of EIPs in each update - either the first 5 or set up a process to determine which 5 make it. It also might make sense to discuss the EIPs outside of the call particularly when there's so many like we have now. 

**Tim:** So that's actually mostly happening. Discussion happens on ETH Magicians and Gitter. Some happens on Core Dev call, but most discussion is elsewhere. 

**Brett:** I'll drop a note with Cat Herders to Hudson asking we can help in any way in light of high number of EIPs in various stages of development without their respective champions actually on the call.

**Action 13.1:** Brett to discuss with Hudson how Cat Herders can help with EIP process

## 3. Updates on the action items from Constantinople post-mortem

**Brett:** Charles was going to send through the update. It hasn't come through yet.  

## 4. Open ECH Github Issues

**Brett:** There's a bit of an issue backlog. Some can probably be closed off pretty quickly when we have several Cat Herders on the call. Several issues including multi-sig account, documenting how to livestream the Core Dev call, figuring out  lcation/time/place of next meeting. 

**Tim:** I'm happy to review them and ping relevant people for respective issues. 

**Brett:** Another issue to where we can potentially help with ETH 2.0 beyond meeting notes. Perhaps forming a working group amidst the Cat Herders to figure this out. Things like documenting where different clients are at so we know who's ready and have clear cross team communication. 

** **
**Action 13.2:** Brett leave note in ECH Gitter to set up a working group for helping ETH 2.0
** **

## 5. Funding/accounting/multisig

**Brett:** There's been some Gitter discussion regarding funding from Gitcoin. **ACTION 12.2** 

**Hugo:** I believe that issue has been resolved. But let's doublecheck.

## 6. Update on the Ethereum Development Portal designs/structure

**Brett:** Charles isn't present to discuss this.  

## 7. Website Design

**Hugo:** The item that was urgent - a misdirected link - has been resolved. It's a bit difficult to brainstorm the look and role of the website. Hoping we can get together in Berlin or DevCon and figure this out.  

## 8. DevCon Workshop

**Tim:** Felt like a lot of talk at DevCon last year happened behind closed doors. This year feels far better organized in having core issues discussed. It could make sense for Cat Herders to do a quick workshop explaining who we are and then fielding questions about how others can get involved. What do y'all think? 

**Brett:** Sounds super valuable to me. It would be helpful to establish clear goals for what we want to get out of the workshop. 

**Hugo:** Also a great opportunity for community engagement. 

**Tim:** I'm happy to put together a talk proposal and will post in ECH channel and discuss from there. 

** **
**Action 13.3:** Tim to compose Cat Herder talk proposal and post in ECH Gitter to discuss
