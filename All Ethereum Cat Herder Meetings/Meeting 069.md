# 1. Network upgrade


## 1.1 Altair

Altair is expected in October on the 27th. The epoch number was shared in the last meeting. 

Specs where released, a minor release, that fixes some Altair and merge test generators. Highly recommended for clients to update.

## 1.2 Arrow Glacier

The next network upgrade on Ethereum mainnet is Arrow Glacier.

This upgrade is to adjust the difficulty bomb for 10.5 M blocks from the fork block number, which is yet to be decided. The upgrade is planned in the month of December.

## 1.3 Amphora testnet

There are more than 40 representatives who joined. There was a merge interop workshop for testing.

Video demo was posted on the merge testnet. This was considered successful testing for the merge, or consensus change from PoW to PoS.


# 2. ECH updates

## 2.1 ECH website updating

We're looking for a page for the merge. Currently we have provided the merge checklist. But it would be better to provide more info, like the Amphora testnet, and other educational resources.

Is anyone able to assist with this? George is keen to pick it up.

This content is relevant to those who want to keep up-to-date with the merge.

## 2.2 ECH engineering

Currently working on the EIP bot and Stagnant bot. The stagnant bot proved to be more complicated than initially expected. 

The stagnant bot isn't working with the base feature currently. So prioritizing bug fixing, before including more features.

Pooja added another issue in the EIP bot repo. Not a high priority. We'd like the bot to interact with the issue section as well. This would help us find the stale issues.

## 2.3 Cat blazers

William's been busy the last couple weeks doing onboarding. 

He has a meeting with someone who may help with EIP initiative in a couple of days.

Also has another project he needs to see what's going on with.

Also looking into branching content into a podcast like format. Hoping to see something early November.

## 2.4 EIP Insight

EIP-4337 - account abstraction. It's an ERC.

The other one is the difficulty bomb proposal, to push until May 2022. 

One proposal went from Draft to Review: EIP-1581 - non-wallet usage of keys.

The bot has moved 13 proposals to Stagnant this month.

Authors can move their EIPs out of stagnant by opening a Pull Request.

## 2.5 Peep an EIP

Upcoming meetings can be found on PEEPanEIP schedule.

There is a meeting planned Oct 13 on EIP-3607 - Reject tx from senders with deployed code. This EIP may not be following the traditional path to final status. It has been talked about in the ACD meeting.

# 2.6 Meeting notes and action items for ECH

Because of the dev's engagement with the Amphora testnet, most meetings were cancelled.

All Core Dev meeting 123
Consensus meeting (no meeting)
The Merge (no meeting)
EIP Improvement Process meeting (no meeting)

New community members meeting. This meeting was organized for those who filled in the onboarding form. One is already involved, the other we referred to JSON RPC team. William is in touch with another resource.

## Actions

- **69.1** - Add better resources for the Merge in the ECH website (George)
- **69.2** - William's podcast intiative

# 3. New ideas - brainstorming

In the last meeting we discussed NFT for EIP authors (Final EIPs). This is to show a token of appreciation.

Pooja was talking to someone from the Alchemy team. Looking to get something designed for Ethereum Cat Herders that can be for individual proposals. 

Pooja recently created a group to plan this further. Expecting updates in the coming weeks.

## Actions

- **69.3** - Continue NFT for EIP final status authors


# 4. Events & Hackathon

hackCBS 4.0 - 29th-31st October. We have a meeting with the organizer last week. We agreed to be a community partner to support this hackathon. We have the details available in the ECH discord hackathon channel. Reach out to us if you would like to be a community partner for any event you are organizing, as we'll help promote.

ETHOnline - Sep 17 - Oct 15, 2021

# 5. ECH funding

CLR launched the 8th round. We're planning on participating. We recieved support from over 500 users in Gitcoin's last round. 

# 6. Discuss and close the ECH GitHub Issues/PRs
ethereum-cat-herders/PM
ethereum-cat-herders/funding

There's no open issues on funding requests. 

# 7. Review of outstanding action items from previous ECH meetings

We had a meeting with the organizer of DeFi Con 2022. We planned a small session of participants of EthNY. On October 21st, we'll be sharing details. It'll be an introductory session on what ECH does. DeFi Con is planned in the summer of 2022.

We hope to have onboarding meetings once a month. We can scale to 2x a month, depending on the amount of people applying.
