Brett: Timeframes for forks?

Pooja: Istanbul 1 post Devcon5 and Istanbul 2 in Q1 2020.

## 2. Updates on the action items from Constantinople post-mortem

Charles:  None

## 3. Funding/accounting/multisig

Brent: From [Issue 4362](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/4362) there appears to be a discrepancy between what was donated and the final number.

Brett: A calculation error perhaps?

William: This does not appear to a be a calculation issue. It is very odd.

Brent: I worked with Kevin Owoki through the spreadsheet the numbers add up. But from what was donated and what was received there appears to be about $1000 off. Kevin is looking into it.

William: Is it appears a bug with uniswap?

Brent: Disagree. Uniswap was correct. It is the Gitcoin donations that do not add up.

William: Will work with Brent after the call to get up speed.

**ACTION 17.1:** William to look into Brent's findings around the funding and see if there is any more that can be done to resolve the issue.
