**PoojaRanjan** [00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1s): Welcome to Ethereum Cat Herders Meeting #115. This is the issue number #367 on Ethereum Github PM repo. We have first item on the agenda is a project demo by SafeStake team and after that we will have Ethereum Network upgrades events and information General update discussion and any New Initiative or Association with the different groups that we are working on.So starting with the first item here let me invite Chris Isaac from SafeState team, maybe introduce himself and provide an overview on the project. Welcome Chris!

## 1. Project Demo - SafeStakeDVT

**Chrish Isaac**[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=48s): Hi Pooja! Thanks so much for having me today. I really appreciate it. So, I'll go ahead and get into the the presentation. I'm from SafeStake by the way, let me go ahead and share my screen here. So essentially SafeStake is a Distributed Validator Technology. It is for Ethereum Staking that's why we're all here and essentially if you're not familiar with DVT,  a lot of people aren't,  some are. Essentially DVT distributes the functions of an Ethereum Validator. It allows the validator to run on multiple nodes safely and effectively. So what is SafeStake we are a particular implementation of DVT ours is a trust-minimized middle layer. It offers a secure fault-tolerant decentralized environment for Ethereum Validators.So what we like to tell people essentially is what all this means SafeStake maximizes staking rewards by securing validators, keep them online and available to perform their duties for the beacon chain securely. So, why DVT? I think this is kind of where the rubber meets the road for DVT and ETH staking. So these facts in order to earn staking rewards the validator has to be online and available. Currently the validator is limited to running on a single node. So there's no fault-tolerance; there's a single point of failure there. The validator private key has to be online and available so that's a bit of a security risk. And so we're seeing some of the large staking providers contributing to Ethereum Centralization and Censorship so it's sort of working against the blockchain's original ethos of decentralization. So, you know as these stakers these are the things that we have to worry about. SafeStake and DVT mitigates these problems by creating that decentralized, secure, fault tolerant environment for Ethereum validators.  So this is kind of how it works, a bit of a demo if you will. So I was talking to Puja before and essentially to give you a demo of how it works? I would have to import a validator and go through some processes that are quick on our site but also take some time on the chain. So I'm going to show you here. It can also take you to our website and just show you the interface when we're done. But essentially how it works is that the protocols takes a validated or private key and it splits it into four shares. So now we have four encrypted key shares and then those key Shares are distributed to multiple nodes and those nodes are managed by independent decentralized operators. And if you notice the node at the bottom there under the Operators at the bottom. Now the key Shares are doing the work via this operator Committee of 4 operators. The private key is no longer needed online. It can be stored safely offline. Continuing on this idea of the 4 operator construct now only three of them are required to create a data signature that's equivalent to the Original. It isn't the original but it's equivalent and the validator can attest with around a 99.7 percent Effectiveness with only
three operator nodes of testing that means you know one node can be offline or compromised and the validator can still do its work. This is a little bit of a diagram here of our architecture. So we're currently in stage one and I'm gonna get into that in just a minute but our stage one  code supports 32 ETH deposits. It's this is more of our stage two architecture where we've got staking pool going and we're having one deposit of two ETH followed by the other 30 EHT coming from the staking pool. Essentially this is how we achieve redundancy the fault tolerance and the security. It's how we help to decentralize Ethereum. And it also helps to expand the validator base by lowering the staking threshold and allowing more people to participate in Ethereum staking and securing the blockchain. A little bit more about kind of how things flow. So essentially you bring in your deposit of two ETH  select the four operators that are gonna run the validator in this scenario. This is when our distributed key generation protocol kicks in. So that securely allows these four operators here on the left to come together and generate the key pair without any of them ever having any knowledge of it or able to recreate it. And then we end up going through the process of Gathering the rest of the ETH and registering the validator in the staking contract. So that gives you a little bit of an idea how things flow. And just some some things about SafeStake here some of the things that we feel are advantages of our protocol. Talking about our stages here a little bit in key security essentially in the the stage that we're at right now stage one with the 32 ETH deposit. Essentially it's a drag and drop and I'll show you that when we're done but it's basically just go ahead and drag and drop your key into the DAP. And it goes ahead and splits it and takes care of everything on that side. And in stages two and three when we're into the staking pool with multiple depositors, that's when we are going to use our DKG. Our DKG has, as I mentioned before, no trusted dealer if you will none of the operators really start that process or are in charge of it. They never have custody of the private key or no the shared Secret. So it's very very secure. Yeah again this is our sort of no code no Tech experience needed interface create a validator or if you've got an existing one, you can just drag and drop the key store files in and you pay our fee and you start with your DVT.  This one talks about HotStuff. This is a protocol for operator committee consensus. So in the background The Operators need to come to consensus on their own. And be able to attest on behalf of the validator using those key shares. Our protocol uses HotStuff which is different than iBFT/qBFT for that matter all. Byzantine, fault tolerance protocols. This allows the three operators to attest with High effectiveness. SafeStake greatly  maximises solo staking. Essentially you know, solo staking nodes, operator nodes that kind of thing. So when we're talking about this in a Solo node, you know these Hardware settings you know it can run about 15 validators. Our same settings and Hardware can serve around 10 times the number of validators so it helps to scale solo node efficiency. Our protocol was also developed and written in Rust so it performs very well. It is very secure. Our entire protocol is powered by smart contracts and a very secure using rust. And again we talked about that load to ETH staking threshold. Our network ecosystem consists of three players the validators of course are stakers as outlined there The Operators that  manage the nodes run the software and a test on behalf of the validators and the DAO. So the DAO is going to you know originally wrote the protocol responsible for governance of the network. And is essentially made up of the team those who own DVT that kind of thing. Validators pay a monthly fee and DVT tokens that's our native token to the Operators they choose in that committee. And the DAO collects 10 percent of all the validator. And operator yields as a fee for using the protocol. So that's how SafeStake is going to recoup when we go live on mainnet. And quickly about the stages, just the 32 ETH that we talked about. This is Stage 2 lowering. It's gonna operate a lot like say Lido rocket pool in the sense that users are going to get those one to one each stake ETH tokens for their deposit. And they can use those other places they're fully liquid. And Stage 3 which will come sometime down the road will further lower the staking
threshold down to 0.1 ETH. So to sort of wrap things up here you know we believe that SafeStake is going to help stakers of all sizes give them the best of all worlds combining the flexibility and liquidity of liquid staking platforms like Lido, RocketPool similar price point while providing that Superior key Security, slashing protection and Validator reliability and effectiveness. We do currently have Stage 1 running on an incentivized testnet called ‘Galileo’. And we're encouraging people to join us, run a validator operator node and help us test the tech stack to scale. We'd appreciate that and if you'd like more information you can check our website out. The address is there.  And quickly if I just want to show you guys, let's take a look here. So essentially we've got these two options, you can run a validator, this is our testnet interface we're on a validator join as operator. So if you want to run a validator. Essentially you can go through the process of creating a new one. We walk you through the process bringing you over to the Ethereum launch pad . Create the validator get the key store file. And then basically we bring you back here to this page and go ahead and on the import existed, drop in an email for type today or notification if your balance runs low. And then here's the drag and drop so basically you just take your key store file drag it right in here. You can import up to five of them at a time. Put your password in this never touches our servers, nothing is stored. Everything happens on the client side. So everything's Ultra secure. And basically click next here and it goes through the fee process. And you're into the network. So that's it guys I appreciate your time and listening to me talk about SafeStake and I hope you learned something new.

**PoojaRanjan** [16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=964s): Thank you so much for the presentation Chris. It was really nice. I love the SafeStake architecture. It was helpful to understand the overall process that you are trying to have it over here. I would encourage people to maybe drop questions if they have here in the chat. I have a couple of them if you don't mind.

**Chris Isaac** [16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=988s): Yeah by all means.

**PoojaRanjan** [16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=990s): Thank you so my first question is about the minimum Staking threshold. You did mention about the starting from 2 ETH and there was a mention of 32 ETH in the first stage and perhaps you also mentioned that the threshold could be decreased to 0.1F wondering where we are right now?

**Chris Isaac** [16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1008s): Yep, so where we are right now is with the 32 ETH deposits that's stage 1 code. And basically that is to you know bring the product to mainnet. We're testing that particular code version in the background. We want to make sure that is Rock Solid and ready to go before we introduce the liquid staking and lower the threshold so you know really we're talking about like the other players in the space getting a mainnet product out there with that 32 ETH deposit and then sort of moving forward from there. 

**PoojaRanjan** [17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1059s):  That is interesting to know!  So you mentioned that the project demo it was on the testnet. I'm wondering if you are also participating in the Holesky testnet or is it some different testnet? Which testnet we are following here? 

**Chris Isaac** [17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1074s): Yeah, so this is on Goerli testnet if that's what you're referring to? 

**PoojaRanjan** [18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1082s):  That's right! I was wondering because they know that Goerli is going to go away soon and holesky would be replacing Goerli. So we generally encourage all projects to move on to holesky as soon as possible. And to participate in the Hoelsky testnet feel free to reach out to Paritosh and me and we can point you to the right people.

**Chris Isaac** [18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1105s): Yeah that'd be great. I will definitely mention that and and see what our plans are for that.

**PoojaRanjan** [18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1115s): Awesome and one last question is about the monthly fees for using this protocol? I understand that could be validated there could be no Runner. Will these fees be applicable only to validator? or only to node Runner? or to both?

**Chris Isaac** [18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1129s): So the fees essentially are from the validator to the operator. They're going to pay a set number of DVT tokens per month to the operator committee and then the protocol will go ahead and split that out among four and take care of it. That way the operator does not pay a fee to anyone. What happens with that is sort of 10% of their yields overall yields the protocol collects if you will. So  that there is a fee on both sides but the validator is more of a service fee and the operator is more of just sort of a protocol collection.

**Pooja Ranjan** [19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1188s): All right that clarifies. Well thank you so much and I would also appreciate the team working and using language Trust for writing the entire protocol. We have recently noticed that trust is catching up and we are also expecting an execution client in trust called Wrath. So yeah it's good to see another project coming up here.

**Chris Isaac** [20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1213s): Excellent okay good to know 

**Pooja Ranjan** [20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1217s): Right. Very well. I wonder if anyone else on the call has any question?

**William Schwab** [20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1224s): Yeah, so, first of all thanks for the presentation and I had to be in and out of it. So I apologize if I'm asking something that you already directly referred to. But if I'm understanding right so you've got one private key that's a registered validator in the depository contract and it's deposited 32 ETH. And then basically the work so to
speak of that validation is being distributed to this Committee of operators. So for attestations if I'm understanding right as long as 3 out of 4 agree on attestations. They have the ability with their shards of the key to sign the data in a way that it's recognized. Is so far is that correct?

**Chris Isaac** [21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1269s): That is excellent. 

**William Schwab** [21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1272s): Oh great! When it comes to block production though so, we wouldn't expect all three operators to necessarily wish to construct the exact same block no. How do they get the consensus on actual block production?

**Chris Isaac** [21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1289s): That's an excellent question that honestly I've never been asked before and you know to be very transparent with you I am not the tech person on the project or or you know part of that team. I'm more on the marketing side. I would have to find that information out.  Because there's the separation between the proposer and the Builder. I'm not entirely sure how that plays out. My understanding is that it's really no different once the data is signed on the beacon chain than if it were just one key. As far as the price going after that. 

**William Schwab** [22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1344s): Yeah okay! I get what you're saying but that's why blocks get a little bit complicated to me because with the attestations the data should be homogeneous across all of the operators that makes more sense to me but for the blind. It's okay though I didn't mean to try and bend this lawyer with the technical.

**Chris Isaac** [22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1361s): No it's fine. It's not a problem maybe connect with me on Discord or telegram.

**William Schwab** [22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1371s): I can try and do that.

**Chris Isaac** [22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1372s):  Yeah get you more information absolutely.

**William Schwab** [22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1376s): Kind of in that direction also you were talking about how the validation threshold gets lowered as in to be able to validate because each individual operator doesn't need to have the full 32 ETH deposit. At the same time I mean let me start this from a different angle maybe the number four like the 4 operators per validator private key is that number set in stone or can it also be for example more operators than that to each private key.

**Chris Isaac** [23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1413s): Also a great question. Right now because of say operator fees and making this affordable for validators that kind of thing and a lot of technical things also us and two other protocols as I understand have gone with the 4 operator construct. It doesn't mean it's set in stone. There can be more operators as part of the committee. It just that doesn't exist right now but it is something we have talked about and can be done. So you could have six you could have eight you know you absolutely you could continue to decentralize it.

**William Schwab** [24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1463s): So then using the four operator setup. So the private key itself has deposited 32 ETH. You were talking. I think about a 2 ETH setup for the Operators that they would be required to put down a positive two ether in order to to be operators is that correct? 

**Chris Isaac** [24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1479s): Yeah so essentially there's in stage 2, there's an initiator role that that operator that sort of starts the whole creates the mini pool and we originally had that at 80 ETH and it it just got lowered to 2 ETH. So that initial deposit creates the mini pool and then in the multiple depositing scenario that's when I talked about our DKG kicking in, which is bringing the 4 operators that are gonna manage to validator allow them to create a key pair, private / public and without any of them ever having any knowledge of the original key or the shared secret. So that's kind of the secret sauce right.  

**William Schwab** [25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1533s): So it does mean that also in the end I don't think this is problematic. I just want to make sure that I am understanding it right that if you're charging two weeks per operator and there's 4 operators to the validator, whoever is registering the initial validator.  I forgot what title you gave him. They do have substantially more at risk. so to speak and it's in if there's a slashing incident whoever made the deposit ultimately is going to lose the brunt of the slashing. Even if all 4 operators are slashed it's only going to yield them 80ETH back meaning that they have 24 potentially being lost. 


**Chris Isaac** [26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1569s): Yeah so think of it this way the four there's only one operator making a deposit right. He's making the 2 ETH deposit the rest of the pool does not have to come from three other operators right. The three other operators are just they're going to be chosen by that initializer operator to manage the validator but they have nothing to do
with the deposit only the one does. 


**William Schwab** [26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1596s):  Okay so wait then there's either I know. So I understand now that there's something missing in my understanding where's the 32 ETH coming from as in there needs to be a 32 ETH deposit also right. 


**Chris Isaac** [26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1608s): Yep! So that 2 ETH deposit is essentially filled with 30 ETH from the pool. That's in our stage too when we've got a staking pool but that doesn't exist now.

**William Schwab** [27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1624s): And so and for now so does that mean there's also like a gap in the stake and the there's kind of an initial operator. Actually I should probably just ask it open-ended and now previous to the staking pool so where's the 32 come from?

**Chris Isaac** [27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1641s): So previous to the staking pool it's simply that it's a you have the key store file already. We're assuming you are a single node single person you've got a key store file you're dragging and dropping it you're just picking 4 operators it's straight up DVT no staking pull so that's what exists right now. When we enable our stage 2 code that will enable the staking pool. And then essentially that's when you've got that 2 ETH deposit filled with 30 ETH from the pool okay by the initiator operator. But the other 3 operators he chooses they don't have anything to do with the other 30 ETH that comes. They're just going to manage the validator and collect their fee with the initiator operator as the fourth operator in the committee.


**William Schwab** [28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1710s): Got it and then the rewards basically from that validation are split between the initiator the operators in the pull.

**Chris Isaac** [28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1719s): No the reward is going to be split between that initiator operator and the other stakers that put in ETH that filled the 30 to make the 32 and then the other three operators are going to get paid their fee from the validator right so.

**William Schwab** [29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1742s): Oh but it's a direct fee as opposed to a percentage.

**Chris Isaac** [29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1745s): Correct.

**William Schwab** [29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1749s): Okay I got it yeah thanks. That's it for me questions wise.

**Pooja Ranjan** [29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1759s): Thank you both. Anyone else has any questions? Well thanks Chris, it was really nice to have you here on Eethereum Cat Herders Call, explaining about another option available for Ethereum Community for speaking outside.

**Chris Isaac** [29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1782s): Yeah thanks so much Pooja. We appreciate the invite to come and talk to you guys. So I think at this point I'll go ahead and drop off. But you guys have a great rest of your meeting and your day.

**Pooja Ranjan** [30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1800s): Thank you. You too. Very well moving on today we are joined by a new contributor so let me first invite him to maybe talk a few words about himself his interests with the Eethereum Cat Herders and how he sees himself to be contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem. Let me welcome Haresh.

**Haresh Gedia** [30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1826s): Hey Pooja! Thank you very much for inviting me to the call. So I've been involved with Ethereum and Web 3 since around 2017. And I've been developer by trade but I'm also doing developer relations. And I'm looking forward to contributing to ECH in terms of doing community outreach. Bringing more attention to this initiative or maybe even any other operational needs. So some a bit flexible over there. I need to find a home. So yeah thank you very much for letting me come on board. 


**Pooja Ranjan** [31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1865s): You are very welcome. I'm happy to share that Haresh, has already started contributing. We all know that Bitcoin Grant round 18 is going to be started from today. So Haresh and Santosh worked together to put up the grand application. I'm going to share the link here in the chat as well as I will share it on the agenda for the grand round for Ethereum Cat Herders. So anybody listening to this call if you are willing to support Ethereum Cat Herders, please feel free to share your support and love of where they Bitcoin Grant round 18. 

## 2. Ethereum network upgrades

**Pooja Ranjan** [31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1912s): Moving on to the usual items for Cat Herders update. The first one here is Ethereum Network upgrade. We all know we are working towards Cancun and Deneb upgrade. I have added a link to the specs for both or the latest specs for both the Execution and Consensus layer. Please check it out. 

## EIP-4844 Implementers call 27 & Readiness checklist

**Pooja Ranjan** [32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1930s): We had a #4844 Implementers Call 27 happened two weeks ago or not this Monday but the Monday a week ago. I have added the link to the video recording and Readiness checklist. Please check it out.

## Changes included in the Network Upgrade - Dencun

**Pooja Ranjan** [32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1942s): There are changes included in the Network upgrade and most of them have been updated on Ethereum Cat Herders website page. Thank you for adding those on their website to George. Please check out ethereumcatharders.com/Dencun . 

## Dencun upgrade PEEPanEIP Playlist

**Pooja Ranjan** [32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=1968s): There you will find the list of proposals and also the updates with respect to devnet. Currently we are in Devnet #8. We are having the specs available for devnet #8. And all links are up to date. We have added a lot of resources now, our video and other resources that we have collected from different websites for dencun upgrade. So, all in all if you are interested to follow the dencun upgrade and you want to know where you can get all these information. most of them are available on ethereumcathors.com/dencun please check it out.  Okay we have also added the playlist for PEEPanEIP where we have discussed all but one proposal so we are expecting one other proposal with Alex stroke. I think it is next week. And that will cover all the EIP’s which are being expected with the Dencun upgrade. Last week we had a discussion with Guillame Ballet for the self-destruct proposal which was in discussion for quite some time. So please check out and there's also a requester to community by the self-destruct team that if the proposal is breaking their contract by any means and that was missed and it is like something new, that they have not found it in their research. Please reach out to team on Fellowship of Ethereum Magician. Let them know about this project that you have and the proposal may break your contracts. People are working hard to find a work around and may be able to suggest you something about how we can fix the issue. 

## Other Protocol Development & Research

**Pooja Ranjan** [34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2081s): I have also added the video recording for EOF implementers Meeting 20. EOF is not expected with tank on but people are working towards the Prague Upgrade. So we are also expecting this check out the Mega Specs because there are multiple proposal for EVM updates. So check out the EOF Mega specs links added to the agenda. Anyone has any question comments so far.

## 3. Events, Fellowship, Hackathon

**Pooja Ranjan** [35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2114s): All right I'm gonna quickly go over events and fellowship. And so as I mentioned earlier Gitcoin Grant is open, the link is added here. Please share your support by   contributing to this Grand round. ADCON 2024 location has been announced. it's in Japan.  I'm not sure of the date yet but people may be aware that the event would be organized in Japan. There's a Translatathon by Ethereum.org going on. Today is the last date for making the application. Check out the link added here in the agenda. If you are interested to participate in Translatathon. And for Devconnect - Istanbul, the Istanbul Cowork tickets are available now. I have added the link to the blog post shared by Ethereum Foundation, how people can get tickets to Cowork space here. Okay I'm going to maybe take up the new initiative before we go into General Discussion. There is a new initiative proposed by ZKD to create a video series. ZKD if you would like to maybe talk a little bit more about the concept, the idea that you have in mind and anything Cat Herders can do to support.

**Z K Doof** [36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2209s): Yeah, sure   thank you for giving me the time. There's been a lot of talk lately and I'm seeing a lot of Twitter threads and stuff where people are talking about building your own full node and and getting that started and basically all the comments. And those types of threads are people who are probably software developers who have never stood one up kind of in the same position I'm in. Who are afraid of the technical complexity or the cost and things like that. So I thought it'd be really cool, if we made like a video series that goes from zero understanding of how to build a full node like following the Ethereum docs for how to stand one up. And going through the whole process and showing all the troubleshooting and everything that goes into standing one up building it. The total cost will be put in there and everything and we can make a whole bunch of content out of it.  Putting out blog posts status update videos you know tutorials and we can experiment with what is it like to stand one up that is using the DAP node software or using DAP node Hardware even. Or building your own hardware and then using something off the shelf to put together different EL/CL combinations. I think it'd be a fun way to kind of increase visibility and give people kind of a tutorial that's more video oriented to follow if they want to become a solo sticker or just set up a full node.


**William Schwab** [38.23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2303s):  Does anything have anything like that?

**Z K Doof** [38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2305s): That I haven't seen anything a lot of people are basically referring to there's a one like ethereum.org page that has a whole bunch of resources that you can go through. Let me drop that in. And then there's another one that I saw that a lot of people were referring to. I think it was potentially by DAP node but yeah I haven't seen anything like that yet. I'm seeing one from there's a hyperledger.org blog post that kind of goes over it. I am going from zero to building a full node. So, it would be great if we could use some of our connections and just make sure that the information that gets put out there is accurate and good. And if people want to help out and help me figure out how to wash some bugs and stuff that would be great too. 

**William Schwab** [39.37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2377s): I mean just taking a quick look at YouTube I would imagine you've done this also it does look like there are but I don't know if they're any good.  Not from ETH Staker per side also. One thing that, I think, I might recommend before doing it is actually just poking in ETH Staker and asking them if there is anything like this. Because I think they'd be the most likely people know about it.

**Z K Doof** [40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2401s): Totally yeah I think that's a good idea.

**Pooja Ranjan** [40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2406s): I think yeah, it's a good idea of course and even if ETH Stakers have it. We can also have the information shared but we just need to make sure that whatever are being shared by us is something new. And I am also thinking about like you just shared about Besu hyper Ledger, Blog post over here. So if you are doing a video content to make sure that the content is right. We can perhaps reach out to team if you are using different CL/EL combination when the video is recorded. Or we can invite those team members to have a look, for the correction of the information right.

**Z K Doof** [40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2448s):  Yeah that would be great. I don't currently see anything on ETH Staker, but I'm definitely looking.

**William Schwab** [41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2462s): I'm just asking them in their Discord. I didn't see it like taking a quick look at YouTube I didn't see anything from them specifically but if any of the other things if you just do like Ethereum run your own node. So there are hits I don't know if any of them are any good and I feel like they'd be the people who'd be the most likely to know.

**Pooja Ranjan** [41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2486s): I definitely love the idea and open to support if you would like to maybe start the series. But I mean if you're checking with the ETH Staker that's fine, otherwise I can also pay next to make sure we are not stepping on anyone stove here. And we are trying to produce a little bit different content.

**Z K Doof** [41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2505s): Could you send me an invite maybe to the Discord. I don't see a link readily available.

**William Schwab** [41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2517s): Give me one sec. I'll try and do it. 

**Pooja Ranjan** [42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2526s): I think we have some people on Cat Herders Discord as well from Stakers Community. I'm just trying to make sure I'm just trying to take a look if we have the tag open for ETH STAKER . No I don't see that tag as there. Very well, you can check it in the Discord as well. Cool, thank you. So the next item here is update on ECH access especially for Twitter. I think the access have been updated now. Santosh has also the access to Twitter and we are trying to start sharing information using Cat Herders Twitter. Mostly we'll try to create threads and also share the information with respect to the dencunl upgrade we have a lot of content we would like to increase the reach with the repeated and with regular tweets going out. And the last thing here is about new ideas for Community engagement we always appreciate bringing up new suggestions, New ideas how we can increase Ethereum Cat Herders reach to the community. Last week having a chat with Haresh we collected some of the ideas hope to get some more clarity on those or maybe we can pick up one of the ideas in the next meeting agenda to discuss more and collect more thoughts from the group. So we can start working on it. 
Okay, so the next one here is General updates and discussion. KZG ceremony special contributions blog post issued by Trent and Carl. The special contribution period was open for a few days I hope. If you haven't made your contribution earlier you could have done it in this one but this is a detailed blog post about the ceremony since it started. I would appreciate people taking a read of it this is something interesting that we are trying to create a more education about KZG and the protocol thing that we are trying to have it with #4844. So you may check out the blog post here. In recent news we heard about Gitcoins collaboration with shell. I found it interesting because this is another way of getting mainstream aligned towards the blockchain community about the open source ecosystem. So it's a good thing to see many mainstream organizations coming up and joining us. On ECH Status,  I have added the stats for Discord, Twitter Youtube and Linkedin. We also have added the link to all the social media. So if you are not subscribed to or if you aren't aware if you are not a Discord. You can check the link over here and join our Discord. And the next one is ECH Engineering. I did mention about the Dencun page. I wonder if we have anything new here to add George. 

 **George Hervey** [45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2741s): There's still some stuff on the docket that I do have listed out like adding Google analytics   there's the EIP’s inclusion,I think, I need to remove. One of them if I haven't already.
And then just like a little bit of polishing on the Dencun page in terms of reordering the sections just make a look a little better.

**Pooja Ranjan** [46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2777s): So just a cleaner part and there was this survey thing that we wanted to fix. I think the link is still and currently running but now we have a report available on medium. So we can perhaps move this last survey to survey completed section.

**George Hervey** [46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2793s): So there's a PR for that already. Just need to add the report link so.

**Pooja Ranjan** [46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2800s): Okay so the report is on medium Cat Herders Medium.

**George Hervey** [46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2805s): Okay great I did add that.

**Pooja Ranjan** [46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2808s): Awesome thank you a research operations we are creating YouTube shorts. I have received YouTube shorts of past staking demos that we have in Cat Herders meeting. I'm hoping to upload them soon maybe. We can start releasing one every week today was the third staking demo that we invited the team to present it in our call but we will have those clips available on Ethereum Cat Herders YouTube. On PEEPanEIP shorts, we are adding them in community playlist, you can check out for every proposal in the past three months. I believe that we have discussed. On ECH podcast glad I have ZK on the call today. I am hoping that we are almost in sync where are we?

**Z K Doof** [47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2874s): So EIP #7045 goes out this week. It's already edited and done. I just need to blur it out and then I think there's one more that I haven't gotten the video for but after that we're up to date.

**Pooja Ranjan** [48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2893s): Right, I think the other one is #6780 which we released this week. So perhaps you can release it in the following Thursday. I will share this. I mean I will update the audio of that for you.

**Z K Doof** [48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2908s):  Cool,l thank you.

**Pooja Ranjan** [48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSv4fT24G9I&t=2912s): So that's it about ECH podcast. 
On EIPs insight, I think working  towards EIPs insight website is live now. As per the latest update we have 4 track proposals 5 proposals and review one proposal and final and 1 in the last call. So the final proposal is proposal #2135 commentable interface ticket Etc. I think it is by William. The proposal and last call is a ERC #6492 signature validation for a pre-deploy contracts the last date for review is 29th August. Anyone having any thoughts on this proposal they have suggestion and they would like to see any spec change please reach out to authors on Fellowship of Ethereum Magician. We are not allowing any changes post the proposal is moved to the final. So please request all your changes before this is moved to final status. That’s on EIPs Insight.  As I mentioned earlier we are hoping to have conversation on EIP #4788 beacon block root with Alex stoke. That's plan on September 5th. We
will be having Deneb testing with Paritosh Jayanti, Mario and Barnabas Busa on August 22nd. We are also having a talk on holesky testnet. Holesky is expected to be live on 15th of September. So we have planned a talk with Pariotosh on September 27th a week after that. So we can perhaps talk about how is it working like where we are? Is this is the replacing of Goerli being successful?  And how can  normal project can join and participate in holesky testnet because Goerli will not be maintained by developers anymore. We are hoping and requesting projects to move their project on Holesky rather than Goerli. On meeting notes. I suppose we have received meeting notes for ACDE 167 , ACDE115 and I have also added the recording and agenda for the next meeting for EIP editing office hour. I will have to take a look what happened with EIPIP.  I don't see the link to the notes here. Well I think that's all from the items for discussion here. Anyone else has anything to bring up, want to share anything? Very well thank you everyone for joining us today.  Hope to see you in two weeks and we can continue discussing things on different channels at Ethereum cat Herders Discord. It's got have a great day everyone.
