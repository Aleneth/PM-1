## 1. Update on the progress of the ProgPow Audit 
- Hudson: Call later today with a few stakeholders who have been involved with ProgPoW. Names of auditors will be held off for now. Funding to be discussed from a group of organisations 
- William: Where are they from? 
- Hudson: Groups are the from inside crypto. Having audited crytpos and ASICS in the past.
- William: Struggling to find an audit team to audit ProgPoW. External crypto seems prudent.
- Hudson: Having someone with knowledge of crypto is essential. Conversation with people from S.E.A.
- William: I am trying to decide on whether I should continue to pursue parties to do the audit.
- Hudson: I will be able to give more details after the meeting. Just want to keep the auditors and parties involved anonymous for now.

ACTION: Hudson to provide update on discussion and further action required from the ProgPoW subcommittee.

- Brett: Have reached out to stakeholders in ProgPoW and the Ethereum Community.
- Lane: Gitcoin carbon vote created. Chainvotes.org (14 votes) is similar. Click a button and submit a Metamask transaction. We are expecting some backlash. It is another signal.
- Hudson: Multiple signalling systems are good.

ACTION: Lane to launch the Carbon vote for ProgPoW.

- Hugo: Very good if during the audit let the waters calm down.
- Hudson: Good to get the signals before audit. 
- Brett: Can it be used with MakerDAO?
- Lane: Can be used with contracts and tokens locked in those.

## 2. Website completion
- Hudson: Great work. Launching it?
- Twitter and Community Post.

## 3. Post Eth Cat Herders Community post (how to get involved etc..)
- Hudson: Well done on the weekly community post. We need to find a better way to communicate and provide feedback on EIPs etc. Hoping the Cat Herders can brainstorm to better handle this.
- Lane: We need to identify the scope of the Ethereum Cat Herders. Love to see that scope to grow. Communication is a very important part of this. Core Dev and Public.
- William: As we go through various iterations of work we will start to have a greater reputation to share data.
- Brett: Launch what the Ethereum Cat Herders are about. Need final confirmation of release.

ACTION: Pooja to launch her community post in reddit and medium.

ACTION: Pooja to provide Lane with Medium handle to be added to Ethereum Cat Herders Medium.

ACTION: Brett to launch "Further Introduction: The Ethereum Cat Herders" post in medium once confirmation is given by Lane and Hudson.


## 4. Updates on the action items from Post mortem and how we plan to track them (Subcommittee: Brett, Charles, Hugo, Poojaranjan)
- Charles: Project board has been created but we need to decide on how we will manage these actions going forward.
- Pooja: Will work on that and give updates on a weekly basis.

ACTION: Pooja to work on the Constantinople Post Mortem action items. 

## 5. Update on the Ethereum Development Portal designs/structure
- Charles: Have put together a document. Would be great to have a lengthier conversation later. Probably next meeting.

## 6. Subcommittee to help Afri with tasks related to hard fork coordination and EIPs monitoring
- Hudson: What would this entail?
