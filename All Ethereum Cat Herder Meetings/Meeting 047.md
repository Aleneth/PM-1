# 1. ECH domain & updating ECH information at ethereum.org.

The idea of the page is to pull all mainnet related material in one place. Starting with Ethereum 1, then Ethereum 2.0. ECH notes, meeting availablity, etc.

The goal is to increase the scope of the content and community participation.

The goal is to get a page or subdomain on ethereum.org managed by the Cat Herders.

Sam, the lead developer of ethereum.org doesn't have control over subdomains, that's the Ecosystem Support Program. A shortcut to this, the Cat Herders content can be posted straight to ethereum.org. 

The benefits is the authority, traffic, and help from the website developer team. They don't have bandwidth for large features, but the ECH can make PRs with those features.

William is concerned about keeping separation between ECH and the EF.

The options are create a page in markdown, or create a page with markdown components.

Something to consider is what kind of content to put on Ethereum.org. Some Cat Herder content may be appropriate, other may be inappropriate and more appropriate for the ECH blog. Looking to avoid a lot of project attempting to market their project on ethereum.org.

It would start with the ECH start pull requests to the repo, but then we can consider write access, to merge own PRs.

## Action

- **47.1**—Decide how and if to put content on ethereum.org.


# 2. Progress on new ECH website

Not too much progress. Converted from React to Gatsby. Blocked because of no plan. May be good to brainstorm a plan together.

ECH is in process of getting funding from Moloch DAO, so Alita can get funded to recreate the website.

# 3. Meeting notes updates
