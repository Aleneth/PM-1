zkdoof provided updates on this. They haven't started yet, but have a plan. Plan is to backup Github and Youtube. The goal is for everything to end up on Arweave.

We'll start with the Github backup using Radicle. 

Then we will bescrape issues and comments, which can't be backed to Radicle, and placed to Arweave. The youtube channel will also be backed to Arweave.

Plan is to create a commit to a Github repo and place the Arweave links there, and backup to Radicle as well.

William was going to do the Radicle part.

**EIP bot & EIPV**

We have another bot, which is EIPW, replacing an existing bot EIPV. Happy to share that it was merged to the Ethereum repository yesterday, with the help of the Ethereum DevOps team.

JA asked if ECH is going to be contributing to this bot. JA is willing to contribute. 

Yes, ECH can contribute to that bot. There may be issues open for it already. 

**Learn2Earn**

Trying to setup 2 separate UIs, one for users taking the quiz, and one for admins adding the quizes.

The same POAP will be distributed to everyone taking the quiz. One thing we want to know what number of user the POAP minter is. So we can know how many people before has taken that quiz.
