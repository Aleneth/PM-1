**Anett** [2:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=165s): Hey guys I actually don't have anything to add. We're hoping to go to Maynard and have a session with you pleasure there and I don't have any updates by the way from devcon.

# 3. ECH updates

**Pooja Ranjan** [3:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=188s): Moving on, there are some updates from the Ethereum Cat Herder side.

- ECH Stats 

**Pooja Ranjan** [3:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=192s): The first one is listed here is ECH Stats, so congratulations to the ethereum cat herders and every community contributor. We are now over thousand users on Discord. This is good. I would try to add more updates and more milestones as we grow. We will keep sharing information with the community.

- [ECH website](https://www.ethereumcatherders.com/)

  - GitPOAP badges available

**Pooja Ranjan** [3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=215s): Next one is ech website. The first one is GitPOAP badges, the team of gitpoap have enabled badges for almost every active repository of ethereum cat herder. So if you have contributed please check out your eligibility and collect your badges. These are all free thank you GitPOAP team for beautiful designs and encouraging our contributors.

   - ECH podcast page - [Add ECH Podcast To ECH website ech-website-v2#51](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ech-website-v2/issues/51)

**Pooja Ranjan** [4:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=244s): Next is some issues. Yeah merge of some pull requests that were there for ECH website. We have added a page for ECH podcast. Please check out that page which includes all the platforms where podcasts are being released, so if you don't know any particular one. You can probably check out this page and join and listen to the ethereum cat herders podcast from your favourite provider. This was issue number 51.

  - Recording auto-update - Auto-update of meetings recordings on home page ech-website-v2#18


**Pooja Ranjan** [4:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=287s): There were a bunch of old issues in the repository which we had tried to close. I have been working with one other resource outside the cat herders but he has tried to close almost all the issues. I believe it is somewhere around 10 in the past one month. So yeah now we have a
page reflecting the latest recording on the home page.

   - Network Upgrade

**Pooja Ranjan** [5:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=321s): All the network upgrades arrow glacier, Gray glacier, the  merge page, Altair page. They have been upgraded. They have been updated so please check out the details of all these updates and do not forget to check out the merge page that has a lot of information. A list of resources around merge and probably you can find it's helpful to understand the process of migration from proof of work to proof of mistake. We also have added the model dot wtf chart to track the ttd as we are going towards that so that's on website update..

- [ECH engineering](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues/266)

**Pooja Ranjan** [6:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=369s): Next one is ECH engineering update. There are two sub headers [EIP bot & EIPV](https://github.com/ethereum/eipv/issues0) and [Learn2Earn](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/L2E). Maybe check with the bot side if there are any updates.

- [EIP bot & EIPV](https://github.com/ethereum/eipv/issues0)


**Jose** [6:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=287s): Well there are now four or five bots. I lost the count. Well the bot scenario, I mean it's massive. Everybody wants to contribute and everybody's expanding even the editors finally are taking a huge role on it. Panda and sun specifically, I think that at that pace we must have our. I don't know how many bots but for sure the ecosystem is gonna be very well covered very soon. I mean it's a lot of work  going there.  I would like to see it more integrated but that's okay everybody's free you know to contribute  in the way that feels comfortable. But I think that maybe it would be good to have a call with. I don't know the last in the last two calls from the eipip me calls. There has been no time to discuss the bots and that was something that I was going to tell you. Maybe for the next call, something to be covered.  I don't know early because it would be great to see from the editor's point of view where exactly they want to go with it. I don't know if I can explain myself.

**Pooja Ranjan** [8:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=499s): Well thank you for sharing that Jose. I totally understand this part and probably I will try to jump up on the bot topic in the next eipip call. We certainly are receiving a lot of issues and pull requests that seem to be having more attention the more time of the call and we are not able to get to the discussion part. Yes we will try to manage that and also with this new bi-weekly call that we are planning to start. I am hoping that some of the issues and pull requests are also taking care over there. So we get enough time to discuss other topics on an eip call. But as you mentioned the good point is we see the way they are progressing. Probably we will have more things automated and we will have less manual intervention. More things managed with the help of parts. Well thank you so much for sharing this.

- [Learn2Earn](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/L2E). 

**Pooja Ranjan** [9:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=554s): 
the next one is learn2 earn. Yeah I see we have been joined by George. George has been working on this project for quite some month and this is now very close to release. So i would pass it on to George to share where we are and what do we see next

**George Hervey** [9:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=576s): Yeah, Hi everyone so pretty much we are very close to a soft launch of this. So the mvp for the app as well as the admin application to go along with this. It's pretty much done. I actually just had to fix a quick bug because I am trying to upload one of the co-ops. We would use for the mev and flashback course. I wanted to give you guys a demo but co-op their approval process was, you know, a little bit slower than I wanted and I had to fix the bug issue. So once this is set up. You guys are free to test it out yourselves and give some feedback. Do expect to see some bugs or you know if it's not completely polished that's okay it's supposed to be mvp and this is kind of like the point of sharing it with you guys and so we get that feedback and I know where to concentrate our energy, So really appreciate what our feedback can provide us and hopefully you guys enjoy it. 

**Pooja Ranjan** [10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=652s): Thank you George for sharing that I have also shared a link in the chat for the last meeting that we had yesterday. If people are interested they can follow the recording there probably it will 
help understand the process of it and we have some demo like it was clean shared. We discussed some of the final things to make changes and make the app ready for soft launch where definitely feedback from this group and the community will be highly appreciated for any question. Please feel free to drop your comment on ethereum cat herder discord channel learn2earn. Thank you

- ECH Operations

**Pooja Ranjan** [11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=699s): Moving on to ECH operations, the first one is ECH GitHub backup & [YouTube backup](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/ECHBackup) and the next one is [ECH Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7dgxKMkSyy3HWtQW7OfqXA). I believe both of them are with Zkdoof. Zkdoof  if you would like to share updates on that

**Zkdoof** [12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=699s): Sure so a lot of the automated portions of the youtube backup are now complete. I have about 50 gigabytes of videos on my hard drive at this moment and now I am going through the process of uploading all those to the lens tube. We had a couple small problems or bugs 
that we were finding with a lens tube but sudo's been really great at helping us work through those and solve those problems for us or address them. But yeah we have around 180 
people who have followed us on our lens profile and there seems to be people who are actually watching it on the lens tube which is great and on top of that we're getting all of the r weave urls.  This way we can ensure maximal decentralisation at the end of all of the backing up. We'll take all the r weave links make a commit to github and then back up that 
commit from github to radical as well. So right now we have about 14 videos that have been put onto lens and I will be continuing every day to upload as many as I can

**Pooja Ranjan** [13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=792s): 
Thank you for sharing the link where we have collected the link for both the rv and lens tube for every episode for every video that has been added and has been backed up. So people you do not have just youtube now. You can also check out the videos on different platforms. You can definitely refer to this link here and on the podcast side I believe we have shared episode 84 of PEEPanEIP. Yeah that's great, We should be expecting some more in the coming weeks.

**Zkdoof** [13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=836s):  Yep and We're seeing you know a pretty sizable up tip in the number of people that are watching all of these, know your client series so that's also very good.

**Pooja Ranjan** [14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=847s): Yeah that's great news.

- GitPOAP for ACD meeting 150, CL meeting 100 & The Merge

**Pooja Ranjan** [14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=853s): All right, moving on the next one is GitPOAP for ACD meeting 150. So I am working with the GitPOAP team again to maybe help GitPOAP be distributed to developers. This will be for meeting 150 which we would  be expecting in a couple of months and Yeah. We'll be happy to share more updates as we get on. There is also work in progress for GitPOAP for the merge upgrade. We have a list of contributors from ethereum cat herders and we are sharing it with the team. So they perhaps can be delivered directly to them.

[EIPs Insight](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/EthereumImprovementProposalsInsight)

**Pooja Ranjan** [15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=906s): The next one is eips inside. I have added the link to the month of August. In August we received two final eips.Those are eip 712 and eip 4906. There are 25 new eips and one eip from stagnant. There are 10 potential eips as dropped, I think this is the biggest number that I have seen so far. So many new eips in a month. It's great that community taking a lot of interest and making standards, but I just hope that it should not be case specific it should be
standard in a standard way. We have quite a few proposals promoted to review and there are some in last call proposals which are in last call. I am just gonna read them out, so  people if you have any feedback or thoughts comment for these particular proposals, please register your opinion as soon as possible. Eip 5007 time nft : The last call deadline is september 25, Eip 5192 minimal soul bound nft: Call deadline is september 12th and Eip3675 which is for the march upgrade. I guess the last call deadline is 31st August but it will be moving to final status once we have that upgrade done. So will eip 4399 which is the second eip for the merge upgrade. I see one more eip3525 semi fungible token the last call deadline is September 3rd and there is another one eip 5313 but they delayed the last call deadline has already passed that was August 15th, but we have it listed here because it was
moved to the last call status in the month of August. So yeah please check out the report for the month of August any question comments so far?

**Pooja Ranjan** [17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB8nytASUSQ&t=1065s): All right, we can probably move on, so in PEEPanEIP as we are looking to know your client series.

We have added the recording and probably that is the last meeting in this record of  apprenticeship for eip editors. We are temporarily pausing that meeting. Instead there is an introduction of eip editing office hours in which we are trying to reach out to eip authors and see if they are facing any challenges in documenting the proposal. We are hoping eip editors will be there to help out with questions. Sam Wilson in particular has shown interest and has volunteered to help out artists with whatever help they need in order to document their proposal. So please if you have any question concerns and if you're failing to understand any particular point in terms of documenting your proposal or how that proposal moves, please join us  in this eip editing office hours. You can find more information on the medium blog post link is added to the agenda and also in the event section of ethereum cat herder is discord.
