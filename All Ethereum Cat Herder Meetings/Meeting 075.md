We are expecting the merge this year, the first upgrade for this year.

We shared most of the updates last meeting. 

Kinsugi testnet is live. We have resources available. If you'd like to join the testnet, please participate.

We made videos on the merge. One with protolambda focused on testing. There are discord channels related to the merge.

Anyone interested in active discussion can join the Eth R&D server.

We did Review 2021. There is a video sharing the community a happy new year. We appreciate it Ken.

On ECH website updating, there are quite a few things that needs updating. There is an announcement from the website team. There may be a countdown on the website. If anyone with github expertise, reach out to us with regards to the website.

On ECH engineering, we have a new member, Shashank. Shashank has worked on Github workflows for EIPs. He got in touch with Alita, and fixed 2 bugs. It was related to YAML key value. Issue related to running bots only to canonical branch was fixed.

On Cat blazers, William shared a detailed yearly blog. William will handle the update sometime this month. Not much else to add.

On EIP Insight, we shared the insight for the month of December. For the month of Januaury, not so many updates available. There was a bugfix for a proposal not being displayed on the EIPs website.

On PEEPanEIP, on meeting planned for today, EIP-721. Upcoming meetings can be found on PEEPanEIP schedule.

## ECH Medium to Mirror

We've been discussing this proposal. William will follow up with Trent. Will discuss next meeting.

## ECH video

The first draft of the video was shared. Ken was working on making it more refined. Hoping to have it ready for sharing. 

This year we are sharing our third year of establishment. We're sharing what we've done in the past 3 years.

## Learn and Earn POAP

We are planning on rewarding a learning opportunity with POAP when answering some questions. We're looking for a developer or group of developers to reward people with POAP for knowing topics. We have videos on Statelessness, etc. It would be a good source for learning new concepts in Ethereum.

It's still in the concept phase.

The end goal is general Ethereum knowledge. The content is coming from developers. We want to incentivize people following the educational material concepts. 

Providing NFT is a good idea. POAP may be the easiest one. 

One company called Rabbithole, they're giving NFTs to anyone that completes their tracks.

William is also interested in setting up the architecture.

Twitter poll to gather sentiment, migrating to Mirror. Seems to be in favor.

# 8. Closing Discussion

Pooja was inviting contributions. We'd love to support your idea which contributes to the Ethereum ecosystem.

If educators and influencers are there, it's generally easier to reach out to the community. If you are one, reach out to us.

We've recieved a few applications on ECH onboarding. We'll maybe setup some meetings this month to review.
