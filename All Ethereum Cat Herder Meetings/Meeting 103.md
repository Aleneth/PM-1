# Introduction [0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzugDzArQYI)

**Pooja**
Hello everyone, welcome to Ethereum Cat Herders meeting 103. I have shared agenda in chat. As usual we have a few items to be shared here. One is the network upgrade and then some information about event hackathons followed by what cat herders are doing as a part of new initiative or association with different working group available in the ecosystem followed by some general updates.

## Ethereum network upgrades

So starting with the Ethereum network upgrade, so as we know um we are very close to Shapella Shanghai and Capella upgrade so the first set of information is related to the Shapella upgrade. The [Zhejiang testnet](https://zhejiang.ethpandaops.io/) is live and it is available for stakers to use and test Sepolia. We also have the announcement of [Sepolia](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1624137587970699264) the public testnet for Shapella upgrade which is scheduled to go live on February 28th. Details are um as provided by developers on an issue is Epoch number selected for this is 56832 and the slot number is 1818624. Danny Rand published a newsletter [finalized 38](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/10/finalized-no-38). It contains a lot of information related to this upcoming public testnet which is supposed to be launched on February 28 at 4:04 am UTC. 

Check out the link added here in the agenda for [ETH withdrawal FAQ](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq), it is generally useful proposal for people who are already a staker or who are willing to know about the process of withdrawals. If there are any questions I think this is a good FAQ shared by development team to check it out. We have updated the details of Shanghai upgrade on cat herder's [website](https://www.ethereumcatherders.com/shanghai_upgrade/index.html). EOF breakout room took place last week. The [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6A23FhyfQc) of meeting 6 and [notes](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/EOFBreakOutNotes#-Notes-7)
are added in the agenda. So some of the proposals are moved or planned for the next upgrade which is deneb so developers are trying to make progress on that now, these are all the implementing client team meeting bi-weekly to follow the implementation status where they are with different proposals notes may provide you more information on the EIPs which are under consideration. Another meeting EIP-4844 implementers meeting that happens every week. I have added a meeting 15 [agenda](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/718) which is today and the [video](https://youtu.be/vQGk9FDs_CM) for reading 14. So these are related to meetings which are directly or indirectly related to present and future upgrade.

The next important thing is [Academic Grants Round](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/academic-grants-2023). So Ethereum Foundation has announced an academic grant round so people interested may check out the blog post. I have added a link to the agenda. The last date of submission for grant application is February 27th, so please make sure that you have already made your application, shared with the team before 27th. You can check out the wish list that is added here provided by development team for tooling support. Yeah please take a look whoever are interested in applying for this grant and helping the community with the expected tooling. Any question comments?

## Events and Hackathons [04:17](https://youtu.be/WzugDzArQYI?t=254)

So from the present list we have [ETHforall](https://ethforall.devfolio.co/) that started on February 4th and it will be there for another four five days that is the latest edition of ETH India online series and um it has over 50 000 bounty for grabs. I'm trying to help out the organizers in finding mentors to maybe able to help the hackathon participants implementing EIPs. So 4337 is one proposal which is like which people are looking for support for, so I'm trying to help out, find mentors connect the team and hopefully that will help participants in the hackathon. I also gave a talk on [public good funding](https://twitter.com/ETHIndiaco/status/1624013851426705416) last week in the event. I will share the recording soon. The next one listed here is [ETH Denver](https://www.ethdenver.com/), which is supposed to start from February 24th. I know a few people are planning to join ETH Denver and our next meeting is going to be in this duration. I wonder if we can plan for like in-person meeting at ETH Denver, anyone have any thought to share or I wondered anyone from the present participants are planning to join ETH Denver?

Okay not a problem. Yeah sure we can definitely move the meeting to the next day when, I mean like, we can skip the next Zoom meeting and we'll try to meet people there in person which would not be counted as ECH meeting, but we can definitely meet. I'm aware at least four of us are going there, so we'll try to catch up. Anyone listening to this call if they are planning to be there at ETH Denver, I'm also trying to be there so feel free to DM me and we'll try to connect. As I mentioned in the last meeting uh one of the cat herders, Victor in association with Fellowship of Ethereum Magician team with Anett, they are organizing an [event for EIP authors](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-magicians-session-in-denver-2023/12610?u=xinbenlv) so details of the event have added in the agenda. We can always catch up in the event. There is [Interop Summit](https://interopsummit.com/) on February 27 and 28th. We are hoping to have a panel discussion with Dan ? and Matt Gannett and I which would be moderated by ? from Fellowship of Ethereum magician so if you're around on 28 try to join us on Interop Summit. 

Other than that we have a few other ETH Global initiatives going on in different parts of the world. We have [ETHDubai](https://www.ethdubaiconf.org/),  [ETHPorto]( https://ethporto.org/) [NFT NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/) is also coming up in the month of April so application developer if you are interested you can join that check out the entire list um on the [agenda](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues/341). All right if anyone has any other events which is missed here you can add the thing in the chat or yeah let us know on the Discord Channel.

## New initiative/association

The next one is a new initiative and association as I mentioned that I'm trying to support events and hackathon and provide people like developers from Ethereum team who can maybe able to support the hackathon participants, so I'm already working with ETHforall team the dev forall team from India. I mean I'll be open to help out any other team if they are looking for any kind of connection, looking for any developer or EIP authors who whose proposal they are considering for the hackathon. 

Okay so there is this [EIP author survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3BX3j57iMu8yFlrOJGHCut0KfSZEwxCDdIiL5HW0gHNAEDQ/viewform)  it's a very very short survey like I think it's five or six question, very simple question we are trying to collect this feedback from authors who have already documented a proposal for Ethereum repository. We are trying to collect information on like what they feel about the present process uh how was it when they proposed the proposal and what changes they are looking for in the current process to maybe help future EIP authors come up with their proposal and we have that as Ethereum standard. So if you are an EIP author, if you have documented any proposal for Ethereum repository even if it is in the draft status or in the pull request status, consider taking out time to respond to the survey. This would take less than two minutes but that information will be quite helpful for us we can discuss it with EIP editors and try to bring changes that you think is needed to improve the present process. Link is added in the agenda and yeah you can always reach out to us if you have any questions or comments to add.

The Client Diversity Survey is still active or we are hoping to publish report by next month. Right now we have received over 150 responses, which is great and we have received quite a few information that they want their client team to be aware of. We are hoping to generate a report of it and share it with us the client team, hopefully that will be helpful for both parties for stakers as well as client providers to understand what is the request coming up from the end users. If you haven't taken the survey yet the link is added in the agenda. Check out the [announcement blog post]( https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/client-diversity-on-ethereum-network-3854b5c3c95f) for more information on the survey.

No we are still yet to start the work on GitPOAP for EIP authors. We had a meeting with GitHub team last week and I think it's lacking on my part we just have to initiate the work we have clarity on how to proceed. I hope that by the end of this week we should be having the first set of EIP authors added there. 

**William Schwab**
I am not about...

**Santosh**
Looks good so far. 

**JA**
?

**Pooja**
Yeah, please go ahead.

## General Updates [12:35](https://youtu.be/WzugDzArQYI?t=755)

**Pooja**
Okay let's move on to the general update. 

### [ECH roadmap for 2023 and Recap](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ech-roadmap-2023-recap-2022-8eb00c977891)

So last week we shared the [ECH roadmap for 2023 and Recap](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ech-roadmap-2023-recap-2022-8eb00c977891) at the link here. 

### ECH Stats

I'm hoping to publish another newsletter this week with some ECH stats. We have added the numbers for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EthCatHerders), [Discord](https://discord.io/EthCatHerders), [YouTube](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCD9iiIwTRtLDYcEWONs2Q3A) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ethereum-cat-herders/). It also contains the link if you want. Following us on any of the social media those are listed here please do follow. We have noted that the subscriber to Ethereum Cat Herders YouTube is way low than the users that visit and the watch that we receive so it's obvious that over 80 percent people who are watching our videos who are following us are actually not subscribed to Ethereum Cat Herders YouTube so please share a word about Ethereum Cat Herders YouTube and do subscribe it, so you get direct notification for any meeting that we upload or any PEEPanEIP episode that we share. 

### [ECH Website](https://www.ethereumcatherders.com/)

We are trying to keep ECH website up to date. 

#### [Issues](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ech-website-v2/issues)

Yesterday I had a chat with George who has been helping us with the Learn to Earn application because that application is at the decent place like we have moved it to polygon now. We issued NFT instead of instead of POAP to users who are taking quizzes. We are considering to revive ECH website. A few points that we have discussed is like we do not have a testing environment set up for the present website. It's mostly on like we are deploying it directly which is not a good idea so we will try to find out what all things are missing in the present ECH website plus we will also set up an analytics website to follow and collect information on what kind of user database we have who are visiting. ECH website at present we contain a lot of information on ECH websites we have information related to network upgrade, all the history of network upgrades, plus whatever is the active EIP under discussion. We share information about that.

We have the list to ECH podcast like we are broadcasting on different platforms so you can find all the platform listed over there and pick up what you like and you can follow us over there for all the broadcast those are coming up on yeah those are published by Ethereum Cat Herders. So a lot of information is there, try to check out our website and if you have suggestions to further improve do let us know we would now like to focus on the cat herders’ website. 

### [ECH Engineering](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/issues/266)

Next one is ECH engineering. EIP bot - a new bot created by Pandapip has been activated. Now people can see a lot of new changes. Now ERCs are actually
written as ERC so you wouldn't find it written as EIP-20 it would be ERC-20 so
it's a clear classification of if it is an ERC or it is any other proposal, any other standard right EIP or informational or Meta EIP.So other than ERC all other proposals are listed as EIP, so check out the new page layout and we would appreciate any feedback if you have to further improve the appearance.

Do we have any other update on bot? Okay, we are also...

**JA**
Not from me, no. I just listened in the last EIPIP meeting exactly what you say that there is a new there is a new bot that is classifying difference in the ERCs and the EIP so that's fine.

**Pooja**
That is right yeah. Okay another problem. We do have a bot EIPW, which is in Rust language and Sam Wilson is looking for some support so if anyone's having knowledge of rust and may be interested to help out with the bot please reach out. We are planning to add a few new features in that, especially like having EIP number generated by bot so there are quite a few issues open on EIPW GitHub. Check out if you are interested to contribute, reach out.

### [Learn2Earn App](https://l2e.ethereumcatherders.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/L2E)

As I mentioned, Learn to Earn app is now ready and live. People interested in collecting nfts may give it a try. We have the link added here. Jose I see your hand. You want to share something?

**JA**
Yeah just to confirm is there any is any grant for the collaboration or just open source collaboration, that no grant?

**Pooja**
Okay, no, people who are trying to support to the bot development if they would like we can definitely help us with the supporter. We do have 20 hours with us for updating the bots so yeah if we people have interest they can reach out to me I'll provide more information. 

### ECH Operations

#### ECH GitHub backup & [YouTube backup](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/ECHBackup), [ECH Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7dgxKMkSyy3HWtQW7OfqXA)

Okay so that's all about engineering on ECH operations, we are working on podcast right now I do not have much updates on YouTube backup but we are producing
podcast on PEEPanEIP.

### [EIPs Insight WIP EIPsInsight website](https://eipsinsight.com/)

Next is EIP Insight. So in the month of February, we received 10 new drafts of EIPs and ERCs combined. There are 16 proposals in review. Three proposals are final and we have got 16 proposals in stagnant status. Final proposals are 4955 render metadata extension for NFT, 6150 hierarchical NFT and 5267 retrieval of EIP-712 domain. All
of these are in ERC category. Okay so that's on EIP Insight. 

### [PEEPanEIP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxqu0PKKyMzG_3BJV_xZTi1F)

The next one is PEEPanEIP, we have a [PEEPanEIP planned](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/projects/2) for EIP-4337 which is scheduled on February 15th at 18:30 UTC. We will have Yoav from Ethereum Foundation, to talk about the latest changes in the proposal and he will also share reports of audit that has been conducted, a few more project implementation, so I hope that it is going to be interesting discussion. If you have interest in EIP 4337, either you have implemented into your project, or planning to do so feel free to join the conversation with Yoav on February 15th at 18:30 UTC, will try to share the recording in the following week. We do have a form in which you can share your question or you can just leave your question on Cat Herders Discord general channel. If you can't join the meeting and we'll try to share that with the guest to have your questions answered. 

### [Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1axM1KaKc-GCcoPbAnYTOhgLnxXsBVoO5XRjTN3CLnck/edit#gid=0) and action items for ECH

We have meeting notes available for all meetings. I guess that is very good. We
have ACDE meeting, that is execution layer meeting [notes 154](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/719), the next one should be ACDC the consensus layer meeting for [notes 102](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/723), and [EIPIP meeting](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/pull/214).

We have added a new EIP editor so that is especially for proposals which are coming from consensus layer. Last week in the EIPIP meeting there was this proposal of separating the repo to help consensus layer also get the comfort to be able to join the EIP process that is there for execution layer as per the meeting it looks like people want to experiment with having a new EIP editor and have him get the access that is needed to shepherd proposals which are coming from consensus layers so they don't have to wait longer in the pull request form, and we should be able to like come move them sooner rather than later to have it in the standard form. As I mentioned in the beginning of the call we do have an EIP author's survey. This is especially for EIP authors to collect their feedback in terms of issues and challenges they are facing with the present system, if there are any, and any suggestion that they would like to share with us so we can improve our present process and it should be common for all sort of EIPs, including ERCs. So even if you are an ERC author, this survey is applicable for you too please respond to the survey.

### Other Community Meetings

#### [EIP Editing Office Hour Meeting 11 Recording](https://youtu.be/PPZzu4dc13g) & [Meeting 11 Agenda](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/212)

Okay we have other community meetings so we did EIP editing office hour last week and the next one is proposed next Tuesday, for new authors who are looking for any kind of help with EIP editors. I think this is a very good place. This has been receiving a lot of good response from new authors. So if you think your pull request is not moving it's not getting immersed or you are stuck you don't understand what's missing from your pull request to get it merged you're welcome to join the meeting. Check out the link to agenda, just mark your pull request over there and we'll try to have it responded by the EIP editor. So that's mostly on the agenda side that was listed today. Okay I see a question or not.

Okay, anything else from anyone?

**Santosh**
I just wanted to check what happened with the YouTube backup. 

**Pooja**
Oh I'm not sure like, I also need to check with the ZK. He was working on it, unfortunately he seems to be bandwidth constraint as well as we are trying to lower the amount of effort. So we are working on like how to you know optimize it. He is open to uh like discuss it further and he is willing to like continue doing it. I just have not much update like why we do not see anything going here, we can check it out. If you are open to support, maybe we can check it with ZK doof. He is the right person, he is working on it. 

**Santosh**
Sure I'd be more than happy. I'll connect with him and I'll keep you informed. Secondly is there a Shanghai Community call happening? Just checking.

**Pooja**
Yeah right, so Danny and Tim initiated the Shanghai Community call that we did a few weeks ago, and after that each staker community also started a series of withdrawal information that is useful for stakers, like if they want to prepare themselves for the upgrade. I think we had one community call about two weeks ago, like Kim, Ben and everybody elsewhere there are also participated in that. That was a good introductory community call organized by Ethereum ETH staker team and I think there is one more planned for today. So yeah if people are interested they can get more information from each staker’s channel or maybe you can check out the, yes we are on live. 

Okay, yeah I mean more we can expect from the Ethereum Foundation team, probably Tim will add the information on Ethereum / PM GitHub repositories when the next meeting is planned.

**Santosh**
Noted yeah thanks.

**Pooja**
Yeah make your submission in, talked about some EIP, okay um I will try to respond more on EIP side if you have interest uh to support, we have few meetings going on around EIP we do have EIPIP, which is alternate Wednesday we have EIP editing office hour which is alternate Tuesday and we do have PEEPanEIP, which we try to have it every other week to discuss with the EIP author and have an overview for people interested. If you are open to help out with any of these you can reach me on discord channel and all the information related to the meetings that I just mentioned are available on cat herders event section. So yeah check out event section and we do have a calendar that you can subscribe to the link can be found in general channel and it is pinned there. 

Okay, that is all. Hey George, thanks for joining, we were just about to wrap up but nice to have you here. 

**George**
Hi, sorry I'm late.

**Pooja**
Not a problem. I was mentioning in the call that will try to connect with all the cat herders who are planning to be there and eat Denver, maybe I'll start at threat or something in which we can uh see who all are there and ETHDenver, and will try to have something maybe snack lunch breakfast dinner anything together, let's try to catch up over there.

**George**
That would be awesome. I'm excited.

**Pooja**
Likewise. Anything else anyone would like to share, have any questions, before we wrap up for today?

All right thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope to see you in four weeks, we are trying to escape the next call because it's falling in the week and we'll try to meet people over there and we'll be back here on March 14th. Thank you everyone for joining us today have a good one.

 Everyone says thank you.
