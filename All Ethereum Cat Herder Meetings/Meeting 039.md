# 1. Eth2 Medalla testnet launch

-|-

Medalla launched. Finality was reached, but not right away. One concern was an article considering it a failure since it didn't reach finality immediately. However, this is seen as a success, as high recovery was shown when low participation turns into high participation. 

Cat Herders may get involved with future launches. Maybe a subreddit EthStaker/Cat Herders launch stream. This can be posted on the Ethereum Foundation or Cat Herders Youtube, most likely ECH. 


# 2. Email account for Cat Herders

-|-

Brent couldn't get support@ethereumcatherders.com setup. Moved to a future meeting.

Pooja has looked into updating the email addresses of the social media accounts. The new email needs to be made for those to be changed.


# 3. Ethereum Important Installation Survey

Video | [8:12](https://youtu.be/Mixdyi5sdsk?t=492)
-|-

The survey has been shared with the contacts list we have, and on Twitter and Medium.

Respondants include mining pools, wallets, exchanges, and dapps. The general responses are mixed. People are using different kinds of clients. We should share it more. 

How do we feel about sharing it with the ethernodes people?

**William**: Collaboration with Ethernodes is good. But I think a purpose of the survey was to cross verify the numbers. How would that collaberation look?

**Pooja**: Ethernodes are getting information from people who have theirs listed. But we are getting the information from individuals. Reading from the blockchain may be more reliable than reaching a certain group of people.

**William**: My understanding is that ethernodes, while they are reading the blockchain, it's not completely representative. Reaching out would actually be a useful dataset. Ethernodes may read hobby run nodes. But if critical installations show a different story, that's valuable information. 

**Pooja**: I think I'm getting your point. We'll keep collecting this information.

The results:
- 66% has Geth installation
- 44% is Open Ethereum and Parity
- For people looking to switch, a mix of Open Ethereum, Nethermind, and Besu

We will continue collecting for 2 more weeks.

## Actions

- **35.1**—Continue collecting responses to client diversity survey.


# 4. ECH discord channel

-|-

The Discord channel was created. William was looking into adding a bridge for Gitter. We are looking to migrate away to Discord. But, will add the bridge to transition.

The Discord will be public once the bridge is made. One bridging solution is open source, but requires a server (matrix bridges).

Hudson already runs that for Cat Herders. But Hudson recommends just abandoning everything for Discord.

The node operators group would like to open a channel for network health.

The decision was to not have a bridge, and point people to the Discord.

## Decisions

- **35.1**—Migrate old chats to the Discord.



# 5. Cat Herders funding - Moloch DAO & ESP

Video | [15:15](https://youtu.be/Mixdyi5sdsk?t=1267)
-|-

The shares from the Moloch DAO grant are equal to certain amounts of WETH. The WETH was sent to the safe. $30,000 was what was asked in the grant. As the price of Ether went up, that number grew to $47,000. Half will be put into stablecoin. 1/4 into USDC, 1/4 into DAI, 1/2 into ETH.

Keeping it in ETH won't affect us unless the price of ETH goes below $220. 

Alita proposed using funding to create a hackathon. An online hackathon may be less expensive than hosting a venue. And hosting an in-person venue may not be possible in the near term. Tim brought up Gitcoin.

**Tim**: It might be good, if we do a hackathon, to do less technical things. Like improving the nontechnical UX for navigating Ethereum.

**Pooja**: The purpose of the hackathon is to engage more community. Maybe also add a trainer trainee format. 

**Alita**: If the goal is community engagement, than a virtual hackathon may not be the best. 

## Actions

- **35.2**—Continue discussing hackathon.


# 6. 1559 fee market changes

Video | [33:14](https://youtu.be/Mixdyi5sdsk?t=1994)
-|-

There are 3 streams of works:
1. Besu + Vulcan testnet to attack it.
2. Doing simulations of what different people will do under 1559
3. Get a formal analysis on the EIP. It's based on hunches, but no formal proof.

A call will happen in 1-2 weeks, and they need notes.

# 7. New proposals

Video | [37:10](https://youtu.be/Mixdyi5sdsk?t=2230)
-|-

## Eth2 Beacon chain launch - ECH hosting the live-stream

Already mentioned earlier.

Jaye hosted a livestream recently. 

Livepeer was brought up as a possible platform to stream on. 

## EIP specific session

We're hearing from the community that there's not enough EIP information. 

One solution is ECH posting an EIP in 30 minutes articles. 

Not every EIP gets enough time to be discussed on the ACD call. That may be enough time for Core Devs, but not enough for the community.

This may help increase visibility and community discussion on EIPs.

We would invite the author, and he would explain the EIP and use cases. Maybe make a livestream. 

It would be once every 2 weeks, one week ahead of the ACD call.

We can start with EIPs already staged for Berlin. 

Originally, we thought about writing. But coming directly in video from the Authors and Champions may be more powerful.

One thing to make these valuable is gathering questions from the community beforehand. 10-15 questions.

During ACD, one EIP may be discussed for 10 minutes. ACD happens every 2 weeks. So the community learning about an EIP from ACD alone would take 2 months.

## Actions

- **35.3**—Formalize the EIP "podcast."


8. Emergency communication group

We can merge with Eth1 first, then see if Eth2 has something they're setting up.
