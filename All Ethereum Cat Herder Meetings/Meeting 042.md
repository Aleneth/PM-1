# 1. 1559 fee market changes

The Ethereum Cat Herders are available to help the EIP-1559 team with community outreach.

1559 will impact a large number of people in the ecosystem, because it changes the transaction format.

The team wants to know what the impact will be on the ecosystem, and what can be done to make it easier to adopt.

The plan is to reach out to different stakeholders, with a form, and scheduling meetings. These meetings go well when there's 2 people. One can lead the conversation, and the other can take the notes.

Pooja shared a document with the activities that have funding for 1559.

The budget for 1559 is ~7,500 DAI. The first grant of 2,500 DAI is already in the ECH multisig.

The outreach is estimated to 40 projects.

The contact list is a work in progress, a part of the work. There is a high level list of projects, but no contacts for that projects. 

Edson and William will help Pooja and Tim.

## Decisions

- **42.1**—Edson and William will help with 1559 as well. 


# 2. Breakout-room update

-|-

The goal is to collect feedback from clients on proposals, and move forward with implementations. The last 2 meetings dealt with YOLOv2. The EIPs getting into YOLOv2 were made.

A decision on how regular these meetings are.

One goal is to prevent this from turning into a lot of calls, and the right format for an asynchronous medium. Micah, Alexy, and Martin Swende made comments on this, which is valuable to look at. 

It's not as productive when you have half of the people in the meetings. Decisions in those cases still need to be resolved async as well. 

We can decide when those meetings happen during ACD. And push for the conversation to be async.

If there is something taking too long in ACD, and there is discussion still needed, these breakout sessions can be good.

This will continue in the EthR&D discord. 


# 3. ECH discord channel

-|-

All discussion can be moved to the Cat Herders discord, from the Telegram. 

There is still the decision that needs to be made for the ProgPow ECH discord bridge. Hudson will make it. 

As for the roles in the discord, it may be better to give roles of member even without the HERD token. Rely on rough consensus and participation.

Hudson recommends: Participation for 3 months. And that's it. And there can be a trial period as a contributor.

One requirement would be having the contributor role have read write access to the channels they need.

Also, a while back, we had the ECH onboarding form. We recieved 5-7 people interested. What do we have in mind for them? They should at least have a role of community. Then have a track for them to become member. 

And for someone before contributor, associate Cat Herder.

## Actions

- **42.1**—Make ECH discord gitter progpow bridge
- **42.2**—Create associate role in discord

## Decisions

- **42.2**—3 month time period to be an ECH member

# 4. Emergency communication group

Video | [28:02](https://youtu.be/95NCxd2QHes?t=1682)
-|-

A few documents that were drafts were finalized this week. 

We're gathering descriptions of our overall goals. Waiting for Jaye to get back on those. Then we'll know if we're going forward with the description William has.


# 5. Peep an EIP

Video | [30:13](https://youtu.be/95NCxd2QHes?t=1813)
-|-

6 episodes recorded so far. William has great conversations for each episode. Alita is also supporting with these recordings.

The goal is to collect feedback from the EIP authors from the process. If there is any feedback for process improvement, we can add it to the EIPIP agenda.

Another episode slated for tomorrow is a proposal for onchain governance. It has been implemented in some DeFi projects. 

## Actions

- **42.3**—Recieve feedback from Jaye on emergency comms.

# 6. Cat Herders funding - Moloch DAO & ESP

Video | [32:48](https://youtu.be/95NCxd2QHes?t=1968)
-|-

Pooja made a document for the next round with Moloch with Tim and Hudson. Moloch requested an update 3 months after the end of June. This document contains that update. 

The request will be for 6 months of funding, instead of 3 months. 

There may be a fee for submitting the transaction. Pooja suggested withdrawing from the multisig to cover it, but Hudson suggested he would just pay the fee.

We should submit before the end of the month, as votes are every 15 days. 

## Actions

- **42.4**—Submit Moloch DAO proposal before the end of the month.


# 7. Discuss and close the ECH GitHub Issues/PRs
