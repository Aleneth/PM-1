# 1. Email account for Cat Herders

-|-

Options presented were Zoho and Protonmail. Zoho provides free email for up to five accounts on one domain. For Protonmail, the minimum is 5 euro peer month. Another option is Gsuite, but Gsuite is more expensive than the other options. 

Five GB may be good to start with, and if we find we need more, we may upgrade. 

We decided to go with Zoho, as its the free option. Brent Allsop can create an account for us, as Pooja already has her phone number linked to an account. More admins can be added.

## Actions

# 2. Onboarding new members

-|-

Should we create an onboarding process for members? We're looking to add more members. 

Pooja created a form.

- [Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBnO8AFcLbvFFT3AEoiFm8xXy5aeAqiqni5JwcOtMyE/edit)

We can consider separating onboarding by what people want to contribute. Or we can just use a form, which asks what they want to get involved in. 

It may be good to screen people, as a new member may use the Cat Herders to get into the All Core Devs call and cause trouble. 

We can start with a low bar to entry, and raise the bar if issues arise. A low bar being, just a name and what they'd like to contribute to. 

The form may be added to the Cat Herders website. And be shared in ECH social media channels. 

Tim brought up Aragon DAO. Aragon DAO was used early on with HERD tokens to make votes. 

The form will be open for edits for a week. Then be placed on the website.

## Actions

- **35.3**—Onboarding form to be added to the website within a week.

We were looking at what hackathons we can consider.

An application was posted to Moloch today. However, they want to limit the number of proposals shown for a period. So we may wait a few weeks.
