Last Core Devs call was on the new EIP process following the hardfork. The new EIP centric process is still being developed and finalized. 

EIP decisions were to be listed summarized per call. Example: [ACD Call 74]( https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2074.md ).

James Hancock has started the list of Eligible for Inclusion (EFI) EIPs: [PR of EIP for EFIs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2378).

Issues tracker can be used for onboarding. Onboarding issue hub to be publicized on across social media.

## 3. Finances

Gitcoin discrepancy solved last meeting. Ethereum 2.0 note bounties are being worked on. Concern over notes. Notes to be submit within 72 hours.

## 4. ProgPoW community update

Video: [`[22:21]`](https://youtu.be/BzvSdU3MyGs?t=1341)

Ethereum Foundation (EF) agreed to leave remaining funds with ECH (~$4000). Atlantic Crypto agreed for funds to be used to refund community contributors. Bitfly will be refunded. They may fund other Gitcoin projects.

Hudson's response: Can't attend meeting today, but my main tasks for the moment is working with others on the ProgPoW refunds and helping @wschwab collect sentiment about how to help the EIP process. I will have time today to do both.

ProgPow updates are about complete.

## 5. Other Business Items
