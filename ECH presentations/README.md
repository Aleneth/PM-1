# ECH's roadmap, talks and presentations

The Ethereum Cat Herders group is [announced](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/decentralizing-ethereum-project-management-ffff4c09d0ea) on Jan 21, 2019. Since then, it has been supporting the Ethereum core developers with coordination, pre and post communication needed for successful deployment of network upgrades, community consensus gathering, community funding, and many other non-technical tasks. 

## Background

Our initial [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e_sK4_KK-3czeU4JFkoPE4Qqbalyg5BrWFhvj2dKXDA/edit) lead to a theory that outside the developers community, there is very less awareness available about the tasks performed by the Cat Herders. Since the formation of the group in 2019, various individuals of the group have been participating in different meetings and conferences to create awareness.


## Purpose 

The purpose of this folder is to collect various talks and presentations about the Ethereum Cat Herders and make them available for the community. This will also include ECH roadmap 2020 and future roadmaps to provide visibility of tasks that the group is planning to undertake and maybe inviting participation. Because this is a group of volunteers from the community to support the Ethereum Ecosystem.
